00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.930
&gt;&gt;Let's talk about how to use Problets. First
off, what are Problets? Well they're a free

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.340
interactive programming tutor. What they check
for is a detailed understanding of code written

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.470
by others, not for writing new code like Java
Bat and Turing's Craft do.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.210
Exercises are randomly generated for each
person. So you and your best friend may have

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.560
different exercises. This is a good thing
too. There are several phases in a Java Bat

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.540
problem. First there's a pretest, and that's
used to determine your prior knowledge and

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.090
to select the problems that you're going to
work on. Then there's practice where you actually

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:45.430
work the problems, and then a posttest where
they test your mastery. You really don't know

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.399
where you are in the Problet as you're working
it, so don't get to worried about these parts.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.610
We grade based on the highest of the three
grades. Most students get a 100% at least

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.289
on the posttest and often on the practice
too. And you can rework them as many times

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.719
as you want.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.030
So to login you're going to log into Problets
at this link. Now I'm not actually going to

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:13.060
show the login because I wouldn't be able
to get very far. It's not uncommon to have

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.780
some problems with this, particularly with
security on your browser. So make sure you

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.460
get started early on Problets so that we can
deal with those security problems if they

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.280
happen to come up. If it happens at 11:50
and you're counting on turning them in at

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.909
midnight you're not going to be successful.
Also Problets do tend to take a little but

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.540
longer to work, so make sure you leave enough
time.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.530
First it will ask for identifying information.
Please use your real name and your OU email,

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.869
and then it's going to ask you a whole bunch
of questions about your preferences and give

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.750
you a general pretest. Don't be worried if
you can't answer the questions in the pretest--

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.729
that's perfectly fine. All it's trying to
do is identify people who have done a bunch

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.860
of programming before so it can give them
questions that are more appropriate. If you

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:08.860
don't know just say you don't know and move
on. It's just fine. As far as working a Problet,

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.909
each tutor will show you how to work with
the interface in great detail. And when you're

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.650
finished the Problet will send you a certificate
of completion. Make sure you keep those in

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.699
case we have discrepancies in grading, they
do happen occasionally. So keep programming!
