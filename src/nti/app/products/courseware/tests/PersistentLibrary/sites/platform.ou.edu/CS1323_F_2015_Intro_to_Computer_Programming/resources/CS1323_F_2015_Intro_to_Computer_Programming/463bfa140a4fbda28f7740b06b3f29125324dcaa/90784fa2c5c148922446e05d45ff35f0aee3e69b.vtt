00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.629
now let's improve our program with
conditional statement you probably

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:07.240
remember the problem statement

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.530
we're still comparing the cost to to
cell phone plans from

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.639
ATT telecommunications we have our super
saver plan

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.390
enter big talker plan and we need to
consider which plan we're gonna choose

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.010
remember shortcoming of our previous
work was that if we only talk

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.609
300 minutes we'd pay less than the
monthly cost

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.239
let's go to clips show that to you can
see it so here we're gonna run our

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.300
program again

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:42.280
maybe raise it up so you can see the
input coming in

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.280
so notice when we have 300 minutes we're
now only paying $29.99 a month

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:52.670
loop better fix that problem

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.600
because that's not how cell phone plans
work

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.070
so here's the key to knowing how to fix
the problem

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.219
listen to how you describe it if

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:06.220
you talk less than the plan minutes
there's no additional charge

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.700
no credit either the fact that we're
using the word if in english is not

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.710
accidental

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.000
that is the same if that's in Java just
for the little more technical reason

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.530
so the if shows up naturally in the
discussion

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.790
and that's a hint that the conditional
statement is what's needed so

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.829
recall our previous code we have our
plan minutes our talk minutes our

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:33.470
monthly cost are additional minutes our
total cost in pennies

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.079
and we have our formula all of those
things stay the same

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.350
in fact we can reuse all of the code
we've done before

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.460
the original formulas correct only when
the talk minutes is more than the plan

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.060
minutes

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.350
now there's more than one way to fix
this code

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.700
and so we want to pay attention to that
if you fixed it a different way that

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.090
could be just fine too

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.820
as long as the code works correctly so
let's go to a clip

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.869
the first thing you want to do is to
make sure we're in the right part to the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:06.009
code to start with

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:10.119
so if we're looking at the Super Saver
plan which is what we've been working on

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.209
first than what we should probably do

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.870
is to comment out the other plan

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.940
there's any way to do this in Java what
you do

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.209
is put

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.970
slash asterisk before it

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.830
an asterisk flash after it that
essentially disable that section of code

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.239
so it's not going to get our way in
cause us trouble

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.349
one thing to notice when you do that is
that the code turned green

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.010
that is eclipses way of telling you that
that's a comment now

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.760
and so that helps you see that you're
not actually running that code

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.410
so do pay attention to the colors that
things turned out an eclipse

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.440
now we can get up to the right part in
the code here's where we're looking at

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.900
the total cost to the pen

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.159
so this is the statement that we want to
put the if statement a route

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:06.879
so if our talk minutes

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:13.879
is more than the plan minutes now we
could leave our code like that but it's

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.780
a little bit messy

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.500
what we'd like to do is to tab over

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.930
that indentation shows that the total
cost for pennies assignment statement

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.799
is inside the conditional statement the
other thing that I like to do is I like

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:30.790
to put curly braces around here

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:35.010
it turns out that it's really easy to
make a mistake

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.190
and read the indentation

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.549
instead reading the curly braces when
the indentation the curly braces don't

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:43.190
match

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.739
guess what the curly braces are correct
indentation is wrong

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:52.390
so it's important to have those things
matching I find that putting extra curly

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.290
braces and actually saves me time
programming

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.519
but you may find something different and
I don't care which way do it

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.409
now you'll notice that eclipses unhappy
with us right now

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:07.780
the way you can see that is there's this
little red indication right over there

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:13.480
in saying the local variable total cost
pennies has not been initialized

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.030
well you might save yourself but wait a
minute it was initialized right there

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.669
well it turns out that eclipses actually
smart enough to know

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.919
that it's possible that this condition
is it true and when that condition is it

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:26.669
true

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:29.940
total cost in pennies really hasn't been
initialized

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.880
and that's what it's trying to say deal
in other words in this case it actually

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.600
did find a mistake

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.330
so let's fix that mistake will put it
out statement

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:46.100
now this time I'm gonna get smart just
put in my curly braces to start with

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.580
if the talk minutes are smaller than the
planet's

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.710
total cost in pennies up

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.449
should be monthly cost in pennies

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.990
in there we go so now we're ready to run

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.400
now we've got a couple of different
cases that we have to chap

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.870
first thing let's check with 100 minutes

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.699
now you need to think about what you
think the answer is going to be before

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:18.320
the computer tells you

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.190
because if you don't think about that
it's too easy to accept the computers

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.500
answers be incorrect

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.820
even when it isn't so I think it should
be charging us $39.99 at this point

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.130
and there it is that's a good sign

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.740
now let's run it again with exactly

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.539
500 minutes notice that the boundary
between the two conditions

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:47.289
the total cost us $39.99 that looks good
too

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.259
now let's when our regional example
where we had twelve hundred men

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:57.310
lots and lots of those expensive extra
minutes and we see we get $74.99 back

00:05:57.310 --> 00:06:02.050
that looks good now we need to remember
though that we didn't fix both parts for

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.300
the coat

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:11.300
so let's copy this party the code

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:16.620
and go down and fix that code that we
commented out

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:20.639
so this is the code that we're replacing

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:25.000
and we're gonna pay star code in there

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:28.960
we also need to remember to remove the
comments because otherwise

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.360
we won't be able to see what we've done

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.370
so there's one of our common markers to
remove

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.440
and there's another one up at the top
don't let the little red squiggles

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:43.750
bother you right now

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:48.990
because now they're gone one other thing
I noticed when I was growing around

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:53.699
is that I don't have a space after the
Alps now it turns out that leaving blank

00:06:53.699 --> 00:06:56.660
lines in programs makes them a lot
easier to read

00:06:56.660 --> 00:07:00.270
and so sort of an important skill to
develop different people have different

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:01.319
standards

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:04.860
but I like to sort a complete one fought
without extra lines

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:08.360
and then have another thought

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.370
so here in this part of the code the
thought is calculation

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:17.080
this part the code on the other hand is
about the output

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.900
and so it makes sense for those to be in
different thoughts in putting one blank

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:22.370
line between them

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.479
that tells you that they're different
thoughts

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.490
oh yes we should run our program again

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.669
remember never trust code that you
haven't run at least once

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:36.949
and usually many many more times than
once

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:40.970
so let's think about 500 minutes we
decided that worked well in our Super

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:42.349
Saver case

00:07:42.349 --> 00:07:46.930
that would be less than than minimum
minutes in our big talker case

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:50.590
in there we go the big talkers $59.99

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:54.120
now let's bounce up to 1000 minutes and
see what happens

00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:59.069
so will run again

00:07:59.069 --> 00:08:02.910
okay the Super Saver is no longer so
cheap because we're paying for a lot of

00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:04.120
extra minutes

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.740
the big talker on the other hand is just
on the boundary so it still $59.99

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.960
and now lets do 1200 minutes

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:16.849
are original example in their ego

00:08:16.849 --> 00:08:19.940
$74.99 $65.99

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:23.220
so it looks like everything's working
correctly

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:27.599
now there's another shortcoming to our
Code what happens if somebody says they

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:30.569
talk negative minutes

00:08:30.569 --> 00:08:33.519
now you might say people would never
make a mistake like that but actually

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:36.870
people make mistakes of computer
programs all the time

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:40.550
so what will be nice to do if they said
they talk negative minutes

00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:45.950
is to let them enter the date again so
let's go and put that into the code

00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:51.170
back to eclipse now that's gonna be up
at the top

00:08:51.170 --> 00:08:55.410
so will scroll up there

00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:59.300
above are too carefully crafted if
statements

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:06.050
right here is where we're entering the
minutes to talk

00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:10.170
so yep talk minutes

00:09:10.170 --> 00:09:17.170
is less than 0

00:09:18.399 --> 00:09:22.810
what we're gonna wanna do is to let
people reenter at

00:09:22.810 --> 00:09:26.430
so usually it's a good idea

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:30.089
to give the User some idea of what they
did wrong

00:09:30.089 --> 00:09:33.130
negative minutes for talk

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:38.490
does not make sense we also want to be
polite to users

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.000
so don't say mean things to them

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:48.690
the next thing to do is to grab our
input

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:52.149
and pasted in there

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:56.339
enter the numbers minute to talk and
enter it again

00:09:56.339 --> 00:10:03.339
okay so let's go and see what happens
with their program now

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.240
so the first thing we want to check is
that we didn't break anything that was

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.700
working

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:18.079
crow that looks good now let's check for
the case we actually implemented new

00:10:18.079 --> 00:10:22.470
so let's say we entered -100 minutes

00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:26.440
negative minutes for talk does not make
sense enter the numbers minutes

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.350
and now we can enter our 1200 and
everything's working fine

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:36.800
so that problem is solved sort of we'll
talk about the sort of in a few minutes

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:40.089
well guess what there's another
shortcoming to our Code we really

00:10:40.089 --> 00:10:42.089
haven't made the decision for the user

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:46.560
about which plan they should choose
thats unfortunate you know you wanna do

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:48.940
as much work for the users as you can

00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.480
in comparing numbers is one other things
computers are really good at

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.870
so let's make the comparison and let the
user draw their conclusion

00:10:57.870 --> 00:11:03.110
back to eclipse

00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.339
now if you've been paying attention
about you what we've been doing

00:11:07.339 --> 00:11:11.149
you're gonna realize we've got a little
problem here because when we were

00:11:11.149 --> 00:11:13.829
creating the cost

00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:18.190
our total cost in pennies we created it
first

00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:22.010
then we calculated it for super saver
plan

00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:27.390
then we printed it out then we we use
that same cost

00:11:27.390 --> 00:11:30.760
for our big talker plan that's a problem

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:34.959
because now when we want to print out to
make a comparison to those we don't have

00:11:34.959 --> 00:11:36.750
them at the same time

00:11:36.750 --> 00:11:40.190
there's a very important principle here
that I want you to remember

00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:44.890
and that is that a variable can only
hold one thing at one time

00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:49.660
so when you have a super saver plan and
it gets overridden by the big talker

00:11:49.660 --> 00:11:53.050
there's no way to get the Super Saver
planned total back

00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:57.519
so what we need to do is to put two
different variables in

00:11:57.519 --> 00:12:01.149
so we're gonna go up to the top and
change the name

00:12:01.149 --> 00:12:04.589
have total cost in pennies total cost

00:12:04.589 --> 00:12:11.589
in pennies Super Saver yes the name is
getting long

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:18.120
if you do this correctly eclipse will
actually show you all of the places

00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.680
where you need to change it

00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:25.990
by putting his little red boxes at the
side so that's really helpful

00:12:25.990 --> 00:12:29.019
so this is super saver whoops

00:12:29.019 --> 00:12:33.149
control C

00:12:33.149 --> 00:12:40.149
sorry about that here we go

00:12:41.529 --> 00:12:47.079
and here's the last one up

00:12:47.079 --> 00:12:50.709
now with the big talker we're gonna need
to have its own variable

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:54.950
so we're gonna make an int call total
cost

00:12:54.950 --> 00:13:01.190
pennies big talker

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:04.630
and we're gonna go down and fix these
other

00:13:04.630 --> 00:13:10.360
variable names so there's big talker

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.130
here's big talker and

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:18.930
here's big talker if you've been
watching the little red boxes at the

00:13:18.930 --> 00:13:22.300
cider disappearing as I go down and work
on that

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.820
and now we're ready to make our big
comparison

00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:28.850
yes total cost

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.450
pennies big talker

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:37.560
is less then total cost

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:41.639
pennies Super Saver

00:13:41.639 --> 00:13:46.899
well in that case what we want to deal

00:13:46.899 --> 00:13:53.899
only one to print out the big talker
plan is cheaper

00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.480
don't wanna leave an extra line there so
let's clean that up

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:09.560
and here's a now of in this case

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.899
we will do system.out.print line

00:14:13.899 --> 00:14:17.170
the Super Saver

00:14:17.170 --> 00:14:24.170
plan is cheaper

00:14:24.310 --> 00:14:30.269
okay ready to run

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:34.430
webster okay I'm actually kinda glad
this happened

00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:37.860
because these are the kind of things
that people sometimes go and click

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:39.420
Proceed on

00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:43.170
is really important you don't do that
because when you do that you're actually

00:14:43.170 --> 00:14:45.750
running an old version of your program

00:14:45.750 --> 00:14:49.310
you're not running the reversion that's
on the screen this makes it

00:14:49.310 --> 00:14:54.220
absolutely impossible to debug so
whenever that happens cancel immediately

00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:56.170
and go and fix the problem

00:14:56.170 --> 00:15:00.300
so what's the WoW and it's pretty
obvious what the problem is

00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:04.300
now this is an interesting situation
till

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:07.649
eclipse is complaining about this last
curly brace

00:15:07.649 --> 00:15:12.060
because that's where it's detecting the
problem but that is where the problem is

00:15:12.060 --> 00:15:16.470
the problem is actually here I got a
little bit absent minded in Edina curly

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.519
brace when I didn't need one

00:15:18.519 --> 00:15:22.290
this is why you cannot just accept
eclipses word for what you should do and

00:15:22.290 --> 00:15:23.760
what you should fix

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:26.839
the one that needs to be removed is that
one there

00:15:26.839 --> 00:15:30.800
notice that when I removed that it fixes
the complaint eclipse had

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.509
and now we're ready to run you may
notice that this little red X's right up

00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:36.779
here still

00:15:36.779 --> 00:15:41.070
that's because the file has been safety
at once the file is saved eclipse will

00:15:41.070 --> 00:15:43.110
know that our code is alright

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:47.829
so here we go

00:15:47.829 --> 00:15:52.949
1k so if we talk 100 minutes we're
certainly expecting our super saver plan

00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:54.899
to be cheaper

00:15:54.899 --> 00:15:58.949
and that's what our program says

00:15:58.949 --> 00:16:05.220
if we talk 500 minutes again the Super
Saver should be cheaper

00:16:05.220 --> 00:16:11.420
if we talk at thousand men %uh

00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:18.350
the big talkers cheaper and if we go to
our 1200 minutes

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:22.360
the big talker plan is cheaper to it
looks like we finally got our program

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:28.260
working correctly

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.350
so for the remaining shortcomings in
this program

00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:34.560
well one thing that's wrong is that if
the user makes

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:38.120
in illegal David the entry twice we
can't fix it

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:42.170
in fact we don't have the software tools
to do that just yet but we will soon

00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:46.890
now we could ask them to enter the data
third time

00:16:46.890 --> 00:16:50.520
and then try to fix it and asked them to
enter a fourth and try to fix that

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:54.130
and we would get many deeply nested if
health

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.100
and eventually what's more we're going
to have to stop so this is really not

00:16:58.100 --> 00:17:01.330
the right way to fix that problem
although it is tempting to try

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:05.900
the other thing is what happens if the
user enters something like a word

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:07.010
instead of the number

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:11.030
you might think that users wouldn't do
things like that but it turns out they

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.550
do

00:17:11.550 --> 00:17:15.150
and unfortunately we can't solve their
problem right now

00:17:15.150 --> 00:17:18.339
that one's gonna have to wait till next
semester you're gonna have to program

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:20.410
quite a while they know how to fix that
one

00:17:20.410 --> 00:17:24.089
let's talk a little bit about the
culture of computer science

00:17:24.089 --> 00:17:27.390
why our computer scientist so obsessed

00:17:27.390 --> 00:17:31.640
with every crazy little thing that could
possibly go wrong in a program

00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:36.290
well first off we have a social
responsibility to make software work

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:37.200
properly

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:41.580
when software sales people can get hurt
infect people can get killed

00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.400
and have been killed by software if
you're interested in that

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:49.370
do a Google search on their act 25 and
you'll see what I'm talking about

00:17:49.370 --> 00:17:53.010
so it's very important that we have a
social responsibility

00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:56.420
to the people who use our software to
make sure it works properly

00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.240
but beyond that we also have a
professional responsibility

00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:03.630
to make sure that our software works
properly so

00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:07.370
getting things exactly perfect is part
of our way of expressing

00:18:07.370 --> 00:18:11.540
who we are as professionals what's more

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.660
if our software doesn't work correctly
employers will eventually fire

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:20.820
and so that's a good motivation to
another thing I want to talk a little

00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.720
bit about his respect for users

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.400
isn't really the user's fault if they
enter the wrong thing

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:31.170
yeah maybe if we communicated our
expectations

00:18:31.170 --> 00:18:34.200
perfectly if the user understood

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.790
perfectly and if their fingers to the
slip on the keyboard

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:41.800
frustrating users is very unprofessional
behavior

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:45.240
users pay your salary when your software
engineer

00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:50.240
we love users so make their world easier
and they'll make your world easier to by

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.280
giving you more money

00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.980
thank you very much
