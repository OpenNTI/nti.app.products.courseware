00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:06.630
&gt;&gt;Deborah Trytten: Now let's install software
on a Macintosh computer. Setup can be the

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:12.539
trickiest part of this class. Don't give up
hope. We'll help you through it. For the outline,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:16.840
first you need to understand your computer
setup. Then you need to pick the right version

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:22.160
of the software. Then you need to install
Java, if it's necessary. The truth is that

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.419
Apple handles this behind-the-scenes very
nicely so it's rarely necessary. The next

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:33.330
thing you need to do is install Eclipse, then
install the documentation if that is necessary,

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.030
and lastly check the installation to make
sure that all the bells and whistles are working

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.030
for the class. Now this demo was done with
a Mac running OS X 10.8, which is called Mountain

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.949
Lion. If you're running a different version
of the operating system, it may look a little

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.280
different, but the essential steps are the
same. Unfortunately, Apple, Google, and Mozilla

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.739
are making changes to their browsers constantly.
This means that daily updates can and sometimes

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.150
do break things. The challenge here is you
need to do daily updates in order to keep

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:09.590
your system secure, so don't be discouraged
by that. Just get online at Janux, and we'll

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.369
help you fix things when they break. Now,
computer hardware actually matters a little

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.729
bit when you're getting things set up. Some
older computers are 32 bit. Almost all newer

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.960
computers are 64 bit. To check whether your
computer is 32 or 64 bit, we'll go to the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:33.960
Apple Menu, and About This Mac, and More Info.
Let's do that now. Here's the Apple Menu,

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:43.130
About This Mac, More Info. This tells me that
my processor is a 2.6 GHz Intel Core i7. Now

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:54.070
on this page right here, it has a listing
of processor architectures. The thing is there're

00:01:54.070 --> 00:02:00.680
only two that are 32 bit. One is Intel Core
Solo, and another is Intel Core Duo. Since

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.369
I didn't have any of those processors, you
know that I have a 64 bit system. It's very

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.210
likely that you have a 64 bit system too,
unless your computer is quite old. The next

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.390
thing you need to do is to check whether your
browser is 32 or 64 bit. So to do this, you

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.470
go to Apple, About This Mac, More Info--the
same thing we did before, but then you go

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.470
to System Report Applications in Safari. If
it says 64 bit with Intel in parentheses and

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:36.480
yes, that means it's running in 64 bit. Otherwise,
it's running in 32. So let's go do that now.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.260
Here's the Apple Menu, About This Mac, More
Info, System Report, Applications is way down

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.570
here. It's actually off the screen on my system,
and then you have to scroll through all the

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:05.570
Applications. So let's look for Firefox. Here's
Firefox, and notice at the bottom right down

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:13.890
here, it says 64 bit Intel yes. So my Firefox
is running in 64 bit. If we wanted to look

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.850
at Safari, for example, we would just scroll
down until we find Safari. Right there is

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:31.090
Safari, select it, and we can see it's also
running in 64 bit. So Safari can be in either

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.810
32 bit or 64 bit, and Firefox can be in either
32 bit or 64 bit. If you have a 64 bit system,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.200
there's no reason not to run these in 64 bit.
Chrome, on the other hand, is still only in

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:52.200
32 bit, and so that will tend to cause trouble
with Java. Now, you can run 32 bit software

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.200
on 64 bit computers, but you can't run 64
bit software on 32 bit computers. Basically,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.040
the software tools for this class need to
match, so everything needs to be in 32 bit

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.040
or everything needs to be in 64 bit. So you
have to strategically choose your configurations.

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.790
The first thing you might want to try is to
make sure that Java is installed on your computers.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:20.040
This is done by default on Macintoshes, so
unless somebody's meddled with the setup of

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.290
your computer, it's very likely that you still
have Java. Here's a test page that you can

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:32.290
use. So you verify your Java version. Right
now it's detecting Java on the computer. I'm

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:43.780
going to allow it to run, and it says, "Congratulations,
you have the recommended Java installed."

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:51.380
If it shows some version of Java installed,
even if it's not the most recent one, you're

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:55.480
good to go. Most of the things we're doing
in this class are very elementary, so the

00:04:55.480 --> 00:05:02.480
latest version of Java is not necessary. If
you have a 32 bit computer, everything needs

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:08.630
to be in 32 bit, so you'll need to install
Eclipse in 32 bit, and your browser will already

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:15.440
be in 32 bit, so that should be straightforward.
If you have a 64 bit computer, you should

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.440
install Eclipse in 64 bit, and use Safari
or Firefox at 64 bit mode.

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:27.900
Eclipse is our integrated development environment.
What that means is it's the place where we're

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.250
going to be programming in Java. So we're
going to need to install Eclipse. We'll go

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:39.250
to eclipse.org and choose Download Eclipse.
So Download Eclipse is here, over on the side,

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:49.770
the yellow button. I prefer to use the Eclipse
standard version, so this would be right here:

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:55.600
Mac OS X 64 bit. Now I downloaded it this
morning before we started so that I wouldn't

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:02.600
have to make you wait while I download it
again. Once it's saved to downloads, you select

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.950
from downloads to install it. You double-click
to decompress it, and it will put the purple

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:14.180
icon on the dock by dragging. It is handy
to have the Eclipse icon on the dock when

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:19.920
you're programming a lot, and then we can
drag the decompressed Eclipse folder to Applications.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.920
Let me show you what that looks like. Here's
my Downloads file. Right here is the file

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:34.639
I downloaded, so I'm going to double-click.
So what that's doing is decompressing the

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:42.400
file in the Downloads Folder. You can see
it's highlighted here, it's Eclipse, so we're

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.400
going to open that up. We're going to drag
this purple icon, the one right there, onto

00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:56.430
the menu bar, I'm sorry, the dock. So there
that goes. And we're going to drag this whole

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:07.830
Eclipse folder over to Applications. I of
course had an older version of Eclipse there,

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.180
which you won't have if you haven't been programming
in Eclipse. The next thing we want to do is

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:24.810
access the Java API. This has descriptions
of resources that Java has for us to use.

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:28.330
We won't use it a lot at the beginning of
the semester, but as the semester goes on,

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.800
we'll use it more and more. If you have good
Internet access, there's no reason for you

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:38.450
to download this, although you can download
it if your Internet access is spotty. So let's

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:45.450
take a look at what it should look like. So
right here is the API. All of these things

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:50.810
over here, all of these classes, and all of
these packages are tools that Java has for

00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:55.460
us to use. Now, we're not going to use all
those this semester, so don't get worried,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:08:00.139
but it is helpful to have all the standard
ones available. So if you can access this

00:08:00.139 --> 00:08:03.810
easily, you don't need to download it.

00:08:03.810 --> 00:08:07.919
The next thing we need to do is check our
installation and make sure it's good. So we're

00:08:07.919 --> 00:08:12.800
going to start Eclipse from the dock, create
a workspace in a good location--we'll talk

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:19.800
about what that is when we're doing it, get
rid of the welcome screen, and create a project.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:27.650
So here's Eclipse. Of course, it's warning
me that I want to open it. We know we downloaded

00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:35.230
it from the Internet, so we know it's okay.
So, Eclipse has suggested users Deborah Trytten

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.990
documents workspace is a good place for my
workspace. That actually isn't where I like

00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:48.990
to keep my workspace. I like my workspace
to be on the desktop, so I'm going to browse

00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:57.670
and choose the desktop 
and create this folder if it wasn't already
there. Of course it's already there because

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:09.390
I have lots of Java projects hanging around.
But to make a new folder, you would choose

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:15.820
here and make sure you choose a name that
you understand like Eclipse Workspace for

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:19.900
1323. Don't be afraid of making your file
names long. It will actually make your life

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:26.900
easier in the long run. You'll probably only
have to choose a workspace once the semester,

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:36.360
although you're welcome to change workspaces
any time you want. I like to keep everything

00:09:36.360 --> 00:09:41.890
together so I can go back and cut and paste.
So, when you first log into Eclipse, what

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:46.210
you're going to see is a welcome screen, and
you need to get rid of that welcome screen,

00:09:46.210 --> 00:09:53.210
so you'll see something that looks like this.
The first thing we'll do is create a new project,

00:09:53.480 --> 00:10:00.480
it's a Java project. So every program should
get its own project name. It's okay to have

00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:11.990
spaces in the project names. Now, it highlights
the one that it creates over here, and when

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.960
you're looking at it, it will create a directory
called source. Source is where our files go,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.310
and so that's where we want to place them,
so we'll select that directory. So now that

00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:35.120
we've created our project, let's start a program.
Now, the first thing you need to do is to

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:40.940
create a class. We'll do that from the File
Menu, File, New Class, and I'm going to call

00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:46.490
it Computer Science is Grand. You'll notice
that the words are smashed together and every

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:52.120
word starts with one capital letter. That's
that camel case thing that we'll talk about,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:58.830
and that makes it easier to read. Spaces are
not allowed in class names. Neither is punctuation.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:03.290
The other thing we want to do is check the
box to get public static void main. Now, this

00:11:03.290 --> 00:11:08.290
is our magical incantation that gets our programs
to run. This is where we put the instructions

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:15.290
in the program. So here we are in Eclipse.
We'll do File New and then Class. So here's

00:11:27.420 --> 00:11:34.420
Computer Science is Grand, and I want a main
program to be created, so that's right there.

00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:47.520
The next thing I'm going to do is beautify
the code a little bit. I'm going to move some

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:52.339
curly braces around. I'm going to edit some
stuff and remove a little bit of the things

00:11:52.339 --> 00:11:57.310
that Eclipse puts in by default that I don't
happen to like. Now, it may look like I'm

00:11:57.310 --> 00:12:01.839
wasting your time here by beautifying code,
but keeping your code neat and organized is

00:12:01.839 --> 00:12:07.149
actually quite important. It's what makes
it possible to read the program successfully

00:12:07.149 --> 00:12:13.390
and easily. It's something I strongly recommend
you learn to do too. So here are my usual

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:19.980
beautifications. Eclipse puts the curly braces
in a little different place than I like them.

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.529
I like to have the curly braces so that they
line up on the left. That way I can see if

00:12:24.529 --> 00:12:30.089
they're correct a little more easily. So I
do that both for the class here, and for the

00:12:30.089 --> 00:12:37.029
main program here. Now this particular comment
is something that's not useful for us, and

00:12:37.029 --> 00:12:42.740
so we remove that too, and that gives us a
little nicer place to start the code. Notice

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:47.970
that nothing is underlined in red right now.
That means that Eclipse is happy. Eclipse

00:12:47.970 --> 00:12:52.100
goes along with you and checks what you're
doing as you work, and so if you don't see

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:57.330
little red x's and bars hanging around, that's
an indication that everything's going okay.

00:12:57.330 --> 00:13:02.450
Now, if you do see x's and bars, don't panic.
It just takes some practice getting used to

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:08.070
where all the punctuation goes. Now, the next
thing we're going to do is add some output,

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:12.610
so we're going to go to the webpage for the
Association of Computing Machinery and pick

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:17.580
our favorite reason to major in computer science.
The Association for Computing Machinery is

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:22.180
the professional organization that's home
for people like me who are professional computer

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:27.930
scientists. It has some wonderful resources
there. If you're interested in computer science

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:33.740
as a career, I recommend that you join the
ACM as a student member as soon as possible.

00:13:33.740 --> 00:13:38.110
Membership is very reasonable, and this is
part of what it means to be a professional,

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:42.190
so I recommend that you avail yourself of
those opportunities. So let's go and look

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:49.190
and see what they have to say about computing
careers. The top 10 reasons to major in computing:

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:54.790
computing is part of everything we do. Well,
you can't argue with that one. Expertise in

00:13:54.790 --> 00:14:01.120
computing makes you solve complex and challenging
problems. That's true too. Computing enables

00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.790
you to make a positive difference in the world.
To me, that's the most important part of computing,

00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:11.810
so that's the one I'm going to pick, but you
may want to go and read the rest of them.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:16.570
Now we want to add one line of code to the
main program, so we'll do system out print

00:14:16.570 --> 00:14:23.570
line computing enables you to make a positive
difference in the world. System out print

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:33.070
line computing makes it possible to make a
positive difference in the world. Now you

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:43.810
probably noticed as I was typing that Eclipse
is putting up all sorts of little red x's

00:14:43.810 --> 00:14:50.810
and red lines. That's typical of what Eclipse
is going to do. Don't worry about that. Wait

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:58.660
till the end of lines to make corrections.
If instead of typing this, you cut and paste

00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.959
it from the PowerPoint, that's fine. The thing
is PowerPoint uses a little bit different

00:15:03.959 --> 00:15:08.300
quotes, and so that's going to mess up the
quotes. You're going to have to go and type

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:12.420
them in again from the keyboard using the
double quote key that's usually just a little

00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:17.880
bit to the left of the return or enter key
on your keyboard. So that will fix that problem

00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:24.880
if you happen to get it. To run your program,
you can choose run, run from the menu, and

00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:32.240
you should see your chosen slogan in the console
window. And there we go.

00:15:43.170 --> 00:15:47.459
If that didn't work, there's probably just
some small error in the program. Compare it

00:15:47.459 --> 00:15:53.810
very carefully to my program one character
at a time and try to find the differences.

00:15:53.810 --> 00:15:58.769
Things to look for: capital letters instead
of small letters, using commas instead of

00:15:58.769 --> 00:16:04.480
periods or other punctuation, these are the
kind of things that cause trouble in programming.

00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.910
So let's see what would happen, for example,
if we put a small s on system instead of a

00:16:08.910 --> 00:16:15.910
capital S. 
Notice right now that Eclipse is unhappy.
You can tell it's unhappy because of the little

00:16:20.459 --> 00:16:27.120
red x, and it says system cannot be resolved.
Now, that's not a very helpful message, even

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:31.209
though it is pointing to the correct place
in code where we made the mistake. What that

00:16:31.209 --> 00:16:37.010
means is I can't find the word system, so
the fact that the word system is entered is

00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:41.990
actually a hint that that's what's wrong.
But the communication isn't very good, and

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:47.800
it takes some practice and experience to get
used to the way Eclipse talks about code.

00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:52.170
Notice when I change it back to system, it
disappears. If you don't tend to be a very

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:56.350
precise person, you're going to need to get
used to working at a much greater degree of

00:16:56.350 --> 00:17:03.350
precision to be successful in programming.
Don't worry. You can get used to it.

00:17:03.519 --> 00:17:07.439
Now if that doesn't work, you can always get
help on the Janux social media if you need

00:17:07.439 --> 00:17:13.669
it. There are lots of people who will be able
to help you there, including me. The next

00:17:13.669 --> 00:17:19.799
thing we're going to do is check JavaBat.
This is at http://codingbat.com. You're going

00:17:19.799 --> 00:17:23.949
to need to create an account, particularly
if you're in the four credit class, and share

00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:29.489
your results with me at dtrytten@ou.edu. Please
don't do this if you're in the open class.

00:17:29.489 --> 00:17:33.970
There's no way for me to go back and look
at work you've previously done, so instead

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:38.999
post on Janux. Let's go and take a look at
what this should look like if everything's

00:17:38.999 --> 00:17:45.999
correctly installed. Here's CodingBat, and
here's a method called sum double. If you

00:17:50.389 --> 00:17:54.960
got this far, it means that your coding is
successful, but let's actually work an example

00:17:54.960 --> 00:18:01.710
and see how it works. Let's enter this code
between the curly braces if a equals equals

00:18:01.710 --> 00:18:08.710
b in parentheses return 4 asterisk a semicolon.
Then on the next line return a plus b semicolon.

00:18:11.929 --> 00:18:16.149
Now don't worry about what any of this means.
Right now it has no meaning, but we'll know

00:18:16.149 --> 00:18:23.149
what it means in about two weeks. And then
you hit go. So here's CodingBat if a equals

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:31.950
equals b in parentheses we return 4 times
a otherwise return a plus b. And we hit the

00:18:39.629 --> 00:18:46.179
go button. Because we have this green check
here and all of these green things here, that

00:18:46.179 --> 00:18:51.950
means we implemented it successfully. The
next thing to check are Problets, so we're

00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:58.950
going to go to http://problets.org. If you
pick topics, and let's do this first one from

00:19:05.299 --> 00:19:12.299
Java. We are willing to accept the risk and
run this application. If you see this page,

00:19:14.299 --> 00:19:18.799
it mean your Java is correctly installed and
you'll be able to do Problets successfully

00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:25.720
too. Now, if the Problets don't work, it's
probably a security problem, so try another

00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:30.539
browser. Remember the browser has to be from
the same category, so for example, if you're

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:36.739
on a 64 bit system, don't try Chrome because
Chrome is 32 bit and you installed a 64 bit

00:19:36.739 --> 00:19:41.440
Java. Students who are taking this class for
credit will need to create an account and

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.700
sign in from the link from this semester's
class that's given on the course management

00:19:45.700 --> 00:19:50.559
system. Please do use your full legal name
and student number and not just your email.

00:19:50.559 --> 00:19:57.460
I really don't know who sillyStudent@hotmail.org
is. During this semester we may have some

00:19:57.460 --> 00:20:04.179
problems with security issues. Browsers periodically
disable Java during security attacks. Then

00:20:04.179 --> 00:20:09.169
you'll have to enable Java to run Problets
again. Turingscraft will work because Java's

00:20:09.169 --> 00:20:14.049
run on their servers, and Eclipse is going
to work because it's running on your computer.

00:20:14.049 --> 00:20:18.779
JavaBat will also work because it's working
on their systems, but these problems do come

00:20:18.779 --> 00:20:24.210
up during the semester and we'll post on Janux
when they do. Enjoy programming!
