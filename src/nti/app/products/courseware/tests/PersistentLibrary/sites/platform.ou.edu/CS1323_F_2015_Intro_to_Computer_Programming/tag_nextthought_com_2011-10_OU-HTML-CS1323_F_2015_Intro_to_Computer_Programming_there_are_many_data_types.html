If specific patterns always had specific meanings, then only a few types of data could be represented. This would be much too restrictive. Many data types are <i class="itshape">invented</i> by programmers as they write programs. Without this flexibility computers would be much less useful. </p> <a name="086dbaf2fbb01195e7df0fc10cef4f29"></a> <p class="par" id="086dbaf2fbb01195e7df0fc10cef4f29">The main memory of a general purpose computer (such as a desktop or a laptop computer) contains very many bits. Programs can use this memory with whatever data types they need. For example, one program may use data type int with four bytes of memory, and data type double with another eight bytes of memory. A different program may use the same memory with different data types. </p> <a name="463c26c30533920df358043375989f83"></a> <p class="par" id="463c26c30533920df358043375989f83">Not all machines use memory this way. A simple electronic calculator, for example, uses memory for one purpose only: to store floating point numbers. It uses only one data type, and can do only those few things with that data type that it has been wired to do. The engineers who designed the calculator decided how to represent numbers with bit strings, and then designed the electronics to work with just those strings. This is too restrictive for a general purpose computer. </p> <a name="f8c3bc5933af7d2e91c051302533d910"></a> <div class="sidebar" data-ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:OU-HTML:NTISidebar-CS1323_F_2015_Intro_to_Computer_Programming.sidebar.question.2" ntiid="tag:nextthought.com,2011-10:OU-HTML:NTISidebar-CS1323_F_2015_Intro_to_Computer_Programming.sidebar.question.2"> <div class="sidebar-title">Question</div> Do you imagine that the computers of the 1960&#8217;s were built to handle audio data? </div> </div></div> </body></html>
