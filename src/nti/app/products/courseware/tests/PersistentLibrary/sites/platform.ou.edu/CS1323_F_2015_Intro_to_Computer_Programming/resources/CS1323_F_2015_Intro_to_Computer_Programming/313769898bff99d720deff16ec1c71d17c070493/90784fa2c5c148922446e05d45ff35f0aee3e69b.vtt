00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.650
&gt;&gt;Child 1: What do you want to be when you
grow up, Olivia?

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:12.280
&gt;&gt;Olivia: An astronaut.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.360
&gt;&gt;Child 2: I want to be a fashion designer.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.480
&gt;&gt;Child 3: A basketball player.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.180
&gt;&gt;Child 4: I want to be a actor.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.419
&gt;&gt;Child 5: A doctor.

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.660
&gt;&gt;Child 6: A teacher.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.900
&gt;&gt;Child 7: A chef.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.140
&gt;&gt;Child 8: An artist.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.960
&gt;&gt;Olivia: What do you want to be when you
grow up?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:25.210
&gt;&gt;Child 1: A mermaid. [laughs]

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.520
&gt;&gt;Adult voice: Do you know what a computer
programmer is?

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.079
&gt;&gt;Child 6: Yeah... No.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.259
&gt;&gt;Child 5: No.

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.430
&gt;&gt;Child 2: No.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.300
&gt;&gt;Child 9:I think it's something that has
codes, and it's able to decode a mystery.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.379
&gt;&gt;Child 10: I think that they—

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.780
&gt;&gt;Child 8: Uhhmmm... wait, what?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:46.499
&gt;&gt;Adult voice: Computer programmer.

00:00:46.499 --> 00:00:48.539
&gt;&gt;Child 8: No.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.999
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Nowadays just about everything
requires some form of programming. So what

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.819
is it? Programming is basically explaining
to a computer what you want it to do for you.

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:03.979
&gt;&gt;Gabe Newell: When you're programming, you're
teaching possibly the stupidest thing in the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:07.080
entire universe—a computer—how to do something.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.420
&gt;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: Programming is one of the
only things in the world that that you can

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.860
do where you can sit down and just make something
completely new from scratch, you know, whatever

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.400
whatever you want.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.190
&gt;&gt;Drew Houston: It's really not unlike kind
of playing an instrument or something or or,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.250
you know, playing a sport. It starts out being
very intimidating, but you kind of get the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.260
hang of it over time.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:32.480
&gt;&gt;Chris Bosh: Coding is something that can
be learned. And I know it can be intimidating.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.690
A lot of things are intimidating, but, you
know, what isn't?

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.180
&gt;&gt;Makinde Adeagbo: A lot of the coding that
people do is actually fairly simple. It's

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.430
it's more about the process of breaking down
problems, than, you know, sort of coming up

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:49.990
with complicated algorithms, as people traditionally
think about it.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.920
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Well, if it's fairly simple, why
aren't there more of us doing it? Over the

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.530
next ten years, there will be 1.4 million
jobs in computer science, and only about 400,000

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.530
grads qualified for those jobs. That's a shortage
of a million people. So how do you start?

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:17.979
&gt;&gt;Jack Dorsey: I was obsessed with maps when
I was when I was a kid, and cities specifically.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.410
So I taught myself how to program. I had a
very clear goal of what I wanted to do, which

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:33.890
was to see a map of the city on my screen
and play with it. Put things on the map, move

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.810
things around the map, see what was happening
in the city, how it worked, how it lived,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:39.680
how it breathed.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.800
&gt;&gt;Bill Gates: The best early thing was actually
using software to decide when the classes

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.140
in my school would meet, and that put me in
a position to decide which girls were in my

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.280
class.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.540
&gt;&gt;Drew Houston: The first program I wrote
asked things like "what's your favorite color?"

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.470
or "how old are you?"

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.069
&gt;&gt;Elena Silenok: I first learned how to make
a green circle and a red square appear on

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.490
the screen.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.440
&gt;&gt;Gabe Newell: The first time I actually had
something come up and say "hello world," and

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.319
it, I made a computer do that, it was just
astonishing.

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.680
&gt;&gt;Bronwen Grimes: When I finally learned a
little bit of programming, that that blank

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:19.959
wall resolved into a bunch of doors. And you
open them and finally you start to open enough

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.470
doors that the light comes in. And to me,
a finished program is like a structure filled

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.440
with light. All the corners are illuminated.
You understand the structure of it. It's a

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.610
really serene feeling to have completed that.

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:42.610
&gt;&gt;Elena Silenok: It took me some time to realize
that creating things with your hands or creating

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.910
code, creating programs is just a different
way to express creativity. I think right now

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:59.069
there's a big emergence of the culture of
making: people who make their own scarves

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.310
and hats, people who write their own apps.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:07.349
&gt;&gt;Drew Houston: Now it's just limited by your
imagination and sort of what kinds of ideas

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:11.680
can you—what kind of understanding can you
build into the computers that it can do these

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.549
things that were previously impossible?

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:23.340
&gt;&gt;Ruchi Banka: All great things are built
in teams, and when you collaborate with other

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:24.430
smart people.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:29.030
&gt;&gt;Gabe Newell: You're testing your ideas,
you're stimulating each other. That's what

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.840
makes us successful. It's not some flash of
brilliance by somebody who then codes 24 hours

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:41.590
a day for three weeks. It's what happens—the
magic happens when we're all on the same page,

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.410
collaborating and building something together.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:47.930
&gt;&gt;Drew Houston: There's a much greater need
in the world for engineers and people who

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:54.370
can write code than, you know, than there
will every be supply. And so we all live these

00:04:54.370 --> 00:05:01.370
very charmed lives. To get the very best people
we try to make the office as awesome as possible.

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:10.550
&gt;&gt;Ruchi Banka: We have a fantastic chef.

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:24.490
&gt;&gt;Unknown: Free food.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:26.660
&gt;&gt;Ruchi Banka: Breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:28.169
&gt;&gt;Unknown: Free laundry.

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:29.590
&gt;&gt;Unknown: Snacks.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:33.710
&gt;&gt;Unknown: Even places to play and video games
and scooters.

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.710
&gt;&gt;Unknown: There's all these kind of interesting
things around the office and places where

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:44.540
people can play or relax or go to think or
play music or be creative.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:50.110
&gt;&gt;Bronwen Grimes: I went on the Bureau of
Labor Statistics for the United States, and,

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:54.310
you know, there's about a third of the pie
that's all the things you would expect. It's,

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:59.010
you know, they're working in the government,
they're working in typical technology jobs.

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.620
But then like the rest of the pie, and it
was the majority of the pie, just split down

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.290
into these little teeny slices of every industry
imaginable. And what it is, you know, are

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.419
computers are everywhere. You want to work
in agriculture? Do you want to work in entertainment?

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:19.419
Do you want to work in manufacturing? You
know, it's just all over.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.740
[Techno music]

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:32.740
&gt;&gt;will.i.am: Here we are, 2013. We all depend
on technology to communicate, to bank, information.

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.650
And none of us know how to read and write
code.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:47.650
&gt;&gt;James: So, you guys, what else? Who else
has an idea of what we can change with our

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.790
programming? What else can we do? Tiffany?
What I saw my students take away from using

00:06:54.790 --> 00:07:00.680
Scratch and programming in our classroom is
that they're willing to push through problems.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:05.350
It really builds critical thinking. It builds
problem solving, and it's something that they

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:12.350
can then apply to math in the classroom or
their reading skills. We integrated science

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:17.840
with this programming, and I saw my scores
go up 30 percent.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:23.330
&gt;&gt;Chris Bosh: When I was in school, I was
in this afterschool group called the Whizkids.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:27.039
And when people found out, they laughed at
me, you know, all these things. And I'm like,

00:07:27.039 --> 00:07:32.940
man, I don't care. I think it's cool and,
you know, I'm learning a lot and some of my

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:34.509
friends have jobs.

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:40.870
&gt;&gt;will.i.am: It's important for these kids.
It should be mandatory to be a citizen on

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:44.900
this planet to read and write code.

00:07:44.900 --> 00:07:50.729
&gt;&gt;Mark Zuckerberg: I just think you have to
start small, right. I think that's one of

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:55.819
the biggest misconceptions about computer
science and programming overall is that you

00:07:55.819 --> 00:07:59.860
have to learn this big body of information
before you can do anything.

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:04.030
&gt;&gt;Vanessa Hurst: You don't have to be a genius
to know how to code. You need to be determined.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:06.819
&gt;&gt;Bill Gates: Addition, subtraction—that
that's about it.

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:09.289
&gt;&gt;Tony Hsieh: You should probably know your
multiplication tables.

00:08:09.289 --> 00:08:13.069
&gt;&gt;Bronwen Grimes: You don't have to be a genius
to code. Do you have to be a genius to read?

00:08:13.069 --> 00:08:16.759
Do you have to be a genius to do math? No,
no.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:23.759
&gt;&gt;Vanessa Hurst: I think if someone had told
me that software is really about humanity,

00:08:24.330 --> 00:08:29.889
that it's really about helping people by using
computer technology, it would have changed

00:08:29.889 --> 00:08:30.919
my outlook a lot earlier.

00:08:30.919 --> 00:08:33.509
&gt;&gt;Hadi Partovi: Whether you're trying to make
a lot of money or whether you just want to

00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:36.969
change the world, computer programming is
an incredibly empowering skill to learn.

00:08:36.969 --> 00:08:42.750
&gt;&gt;Drew Houston: To be able to actually come
up with an idea and then see it in your hands

00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:46.300
and then be able to press a button and have
it be in millions of people's hands. I mean,

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:49.300
I think we're the first generation in the
world that's really ever had that kind of

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:49.580
experience.

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:53.279
&gt;&gt;Gabe Newell: The programmers of tomorrow
are the wizards of the future. You know, you're

00:08:53.279 --> 00:08:55.970
going to look like you have magic powers compared
to everybody else.

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.200
&gt;&gt;Drew Houston: I think it's amazing. I think
it's the closest thing we have to a superpower.

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.490
&gt;&gt;will.i.am: Great coders are today's rock
stars. That's it.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.910
