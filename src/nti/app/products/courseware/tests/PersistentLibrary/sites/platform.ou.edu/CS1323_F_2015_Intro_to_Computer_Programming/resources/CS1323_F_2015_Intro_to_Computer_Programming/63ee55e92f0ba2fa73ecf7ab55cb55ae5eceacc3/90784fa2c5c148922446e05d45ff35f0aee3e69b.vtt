links, participate in discussions by replying

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.459
to existing entries, create your own entry
and save entries for later use. You’ve seen

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:51.980
how to annotate passages, save and share your
notes and how to use the built-in dictionary.

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.879

feature for illustrating your ideas. Be sure

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.049
