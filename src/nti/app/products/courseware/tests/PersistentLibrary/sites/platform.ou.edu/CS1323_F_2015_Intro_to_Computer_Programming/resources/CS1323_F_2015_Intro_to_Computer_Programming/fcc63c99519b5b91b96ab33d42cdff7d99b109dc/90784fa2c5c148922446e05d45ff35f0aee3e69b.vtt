&gt;&gt;Hi everybody. This week I'm proud to join
the students, teachers, businesses, and non-profit

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.580
organizations taking big new steps to support
computer science in America's schools. Learning

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.620
these skills isn't just important for your
future, it's important for our country's future.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.650
If we want America to stay on the cutting
edge, we need young Americans, like you, to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.420
master the tools and technology that will
change the way we do just about everything.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.890
That's why I'm asking you to get involved.
Don't just buy a new video game, make one.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.950
Don't just download the latest app, help design
it. Don't just play on your phone, program

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.510
it. No one's born a computer scientist, but
with a little hard work, and some math and

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.960
science, just about anyone can become one.
This week is your chance to give it a shot.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.379
And don't let anyone tell you "you can't."
Whether you're a young man or a young woman,

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:01.760
whether you live in a city or a rural area,
computers are going to be a big part of your

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.110
future. And if you're willing to work and
study hard, that future is yours to shape.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.770
Thanks everybody!
