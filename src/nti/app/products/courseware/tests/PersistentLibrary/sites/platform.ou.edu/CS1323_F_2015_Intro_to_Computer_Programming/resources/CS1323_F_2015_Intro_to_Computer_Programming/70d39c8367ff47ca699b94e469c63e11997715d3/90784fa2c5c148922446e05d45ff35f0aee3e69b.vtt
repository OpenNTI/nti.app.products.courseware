00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.630
Hello and welcome to Janux. The University
of Oklahoma’s online, interactive, learning

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:07.620
community.
We know you’re going to enjoy learning in

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.450
this environment.
In order for you to get the most out of this

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.119
platform you’ll want to be familiar with
all of the operational features built into

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:17.300
the platform.
With Janux, you’re able to access course

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.170
information and lessons in ways that have
never before been offered. Plus, you’re

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.529
able to communicate YOUR ideas to anyone and
everyone taking the course. You’re able

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:30.999
to highlight key concepts and make your own
notes right in the platform.

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.340
So let’s take a look.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.430
We’re going to briefly

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.800
cover some of the features available on Janux.
We’ll look at how to navigate the platform

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.840
and step through a couple of the main features.
The remainder of the features housed in the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.320
Janux platform will be described in a series
of short ‘how to’ videos.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.660
But, before we watch those, let’s walk
through the platform as a whole.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.539
The list of courses available for enrollment
looks like this.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:00.000
For our purposes, let’s use this class,
“History of Science to the Age of Newton”

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.460
as an example.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:07.950
Log in to the platform, the system defaults to the lessons page. More on that in a minute. In this case the

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.860
first page says, 1.1 Orientation.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:22.159
Let’s start at the top and look at the controls in place to navigate the platform. If you'd like to go back to the library page at any time simply click on the OU logo

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.150
at the left. Above that you’ll see the title of the course across the top of this navigation bar.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.840
From the left side of the screen you’ll
see a series of navigation tabs. The first

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.000
one is Activity.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.579
Clicking on this button will take you to a
calendar for this course. The information

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:42.149
is broken down into weeks and under each week
are the course activities.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:49.729
THESE activities are broken down into lessons, assignments, discussion comments and notes.
Click on one of these blue boxes and you will

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.520
be taken straight to that piece of content.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.189
Looking back up at the navigation tabs, you’ll
notice the next tab IS CALLED lessons. This

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.270
tab will ALSO take you to the lessons in the
course.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.479
Let’s take a moment to look at the lessons
themselves.

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.340
Part of your lessons will be video and some
will be text based.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.320
Let’s look at the videos first.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.310
The instructor for our example course is Dr.
Magruder. He has five videos prepared for

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.440
the first chapter. Let’s look at this one,
lesson 1.3, Stonehenge. Click it and it plays.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.980
Notice you have the option to view the video
with or without a transcript showing on the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.860
screen.
If you choose the media viewer to see the

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.450
transcription you’ll be able to follow along,
in writing what the video is saying.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.900
As Dr. Magruder speaks, the transcript follows
his every word using highlights.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.050
You can add notes right here ON the transcript.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:46.690
If you’ll look down here, there are some
required readings as part of this lesson on

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:53.030
Stonehenge. All the same features are available
to you as you go through and read a lesson.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.620
You can make notes or drawings on a built-in
whiteboard, share them with any one person,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.010
a select group of people or keep them private
just like when you’re working with the videos.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.090
There may also be additional articles that
aren’t required but will still allow you

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.950
the same annotation functions as the others.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.690
Spend a little time with each of these note
taking and communication features. Be sure

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.260
you’re comfortable with them. They’re
very powerful and will change your workflow

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.950
in these courses for the better.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.060
The next tab is labeled Assignments. This
gives you an easy to read list of the required

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.340
homework for the course.
Depending on the course you may complete the

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.110
assignment within the platform, you can find other instructions from your professor or course administrator.

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.190
The next tab is the Discussions tab. This
opens current and archived discussions that

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.710
have taken place in your course.
These discussions can be initiated by students

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:47.870
or the instructor.
Scroll down to see the discussion entries.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.220
If you’d like to read one of these discussions
in its entirety, simply click on it. You may

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.210
read the discussion entries and add your own
thoughts.

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.090
To make a comment about the initial entry,
look at the bottom of the entry for the “Add

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:00.760
a Comment” button.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.430
To reply to one of the subsequent comments
in the discussion go to the bottom of THAT

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.230
entry and click on Reply. In both cases a
window will appear to enter your comment.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:15.000
The final navigation tab is entitled Course
Info. Clicking this will bring up pertinent

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.700
information about this course:
A summary of the goals and objectives, a short

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:21.730
bio about the course designer and enrollment
instructions.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:27.370
Now, if you look all the way across the navigation
bar you’ll see a search field.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.970
This will allow you to search for a term through
every piece of information in the course or

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:37.190
you can hone down the search by selecting,
“readings,” “social,” “videos”

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:41.690
or “highlights” This comprehensive search
covers your course completely for instant

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.190
access any time you need it.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:50.240
The bell icon is for notifications. Click
this icon and a list of entries pertaining to you will appear

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:59.060
Discussion posts, announcements from the course administrator or professor, and notices about your peers adding you as a contact are among the information populated here.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.240
Next to that you’ll notice a button with
YOUR initials in it. Pressing this will allow

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:11.320
you to view your profile and manage your account. You can substitute a photo for your initials, manage your password and change your preferences here.

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.690
The last feature we want to cover is the messenger.
Here you can communicate with anyone in your

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:21.050
contacts list. This allows you to chat live
with your contacts anytime they’re on the Janux system.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:29.220
The messenger is located on the right side of the screen unless you condense the size of the screen which moves access to the messenger to the top.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:34.740
We’ve covered the basic layout and navigation
of your Janux course. Please keep in mind that designers at our partner company

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.780
NextThought are constantly working to improve the functionality of the Janux platform, so the appearance of

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:44.680
some of these pages may change a little over time. But with each change, the platform improves

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.690
and becomes easier to use. As we mentioned earlier, you’ll want to spend a little time

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.870
learning how to use these powerful features.

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:56.160
You’ll find those videos set up for you
on the opening page of your class.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.750
Watch those quick videos then get started
on your journey to social learning.
