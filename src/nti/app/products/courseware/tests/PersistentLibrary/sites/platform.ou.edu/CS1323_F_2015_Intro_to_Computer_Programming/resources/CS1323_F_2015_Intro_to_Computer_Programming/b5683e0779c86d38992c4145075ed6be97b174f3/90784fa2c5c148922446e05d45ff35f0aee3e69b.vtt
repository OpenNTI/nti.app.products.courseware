00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
&gt;&gt;Dr. Deborah Trytten: Now that you've learned
about command line interaction, let's use

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
it to improve our target heart rate program.
Here's the problem statement again: to get

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.270
the maximum benefit from exercise, your heart
rate needs to be increased. There's a formula

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:22.000
that's widely used. Subtract your age from
220, and your target heart rate should be

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.920
between 65 and 85% of this value. And we need
to remember that people count their pulse

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:34.920
usually for only 10 seconds. Recall that we
had some chosen variables. We had age, which

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.980
was an integer. We had our weird constant
that was also an integer, a double for low

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.739
percent and high percent, a double for 10
seconds. Now, at the time we actually said

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.660
1.6666667, but remember we didn't know how
to divide then. One thing I want you to notice

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.660
is that I divided 10.0 by 60.0. I didn't divide
10 by 60. When you divide 10 by 60, you get

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.680
zero because 10 and 60 are both integers,
so even though it's a fractional part, remember

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.680
it gets truncated to zero. So we definitely
want 10.0 divided by 60.0. And we had a string

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.040
called first name.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.420
Now if we're going to write a program for
this, the first thing we need to do is to

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.420
create a class. There are four basic pieces
to this. We open Eclipse, create a new project,

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.520
then create a new class, and create a main
program. So let's go and do that. Here's Eclipse

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:45.439
opening up... 
Here's the workspace... Next, we create a
new project, so that's File, New, Java project.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:11.299
Let's call this "Target Heart Rate Iteration
2." You'll notice that our project appeared

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.280
here in the package explorer. Now you can
turn the package explorer on and off if you

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.060
wish. For example, if you like to have more
space on your screen, sometimes it helps to

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:36.060
not have the package explorer showing. That's
controlled under Window, Package Explorer,

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.790
so that's how you'd get it back if you decided
to get rid of it with the little x. For right

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.599
now it's kind of nice to have it around. I'm
going to click on the source directory in

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:56.050
my project because that's where I want my
Java files to be saved. The little green bull's-eye

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:01.819
here is how you create a new Java class. You
can also do it from the file menu if you wish

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.819
to—File, New, and then Class. But the green
target's quicker. I'm going to call my class

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:22.019
Target Heart Rate. Now, we do want to have
a main program in our class, and so I've checked

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.900
the box here. The box is checked by default
by the way. Do remember that you need to know

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.299
how to create a main program on your own,
so you probably want to wait a little while

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:40.299
before checking this box. In fact, let's uncheck
it, and I'll create it with you. So here's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.030
our class.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.330
Now Eclipse and I don't agree on where curly
braces belong. I like my curly braces to line

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.349
up on the left-hand side. Eclipse likes them
in the other place. I don't really care which

00:03:54.349 --> 00:04:00.909
way you do it. There are certainly good programmers
who are members of both camps. Let's create

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:07.909
a main program: public static void main string
square brackets args. Now unfortunately this

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.989
isn't going to make any sense at this point.
It's kind of a magic incantation that keeps

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.139
your program running, but what the computer
does is it finds the main program and it executes

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:31.139
the instructions in them one instruction at
a time. The next thing we should do is design

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.410
the program. Now sometimes people get so excited
to be programming they forget to actually

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.720
think about what they're doing first, and
I like to do that. I found that it saves me

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:46.280
a lot of time in the long run. So we're going
to use comments to describe what the program

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.800
should do. Now virtually all of our programs
are going to do the same thing now. They're

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.500
going to get input from the user, perform
some calculation, and show output to the user.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:02.910
So let's implement this one step at a time.
The first thing we'll implement is getting

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.910
input from the user. We'll do that after we
put comments in our code. So here's Eclipse.

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:19.380
The input we need from the user is their age
and their name. So that will be what our comment

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:28.300
is. Notice that Eclipse makes comments green
by default, so that's one of the ways you

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:35.300
can tell when something's in a comment. Calculate
the user's heart rate minimum and maximum,

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.650
and show the target heart rates to the user.
So those are our comments that give some structure

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:57.930
to our program. To actually get the input
from the user, we need to construct a scanner

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:04.819
object. And remember that age is an integer,
so we'll get it using next int and name as

00:06:04.819 --> 00:06:11.259
a string, and we'll get it using next line.
In Eclipse our scanner object usually goes

00:06:11.259 --> 00:06:17.160
right at the start of the main program. We
can call it whatever we want. I often call

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:24.160
mine keyboard, but not always. Scanner keyboard
equals new scanner of system dot in semicolon

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:32.789
after it, of course. Now you'll notice Eclipse
isn't happy right now. It has a little red

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:38.110
line under scanner. This is because we have
not told Eclipse where to find the scanner

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:45.110
class. To tell it that, we say import Java
dot util dot scanner, and now Eclipse is happy

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:58.330
again. Well, actually it's only kind of happy.
Notice it does have a little yellow warning.

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.669
Now, you don't actually have to pay attention
to yellow warnings, but sometimes they have

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:08.419
valuable information, so it's not a bad idea.
In this case what we're being warned about

00:07:08.419 --> 00:07:13.910
is the fact that we haven't used the keyboard
to do anything. Eclipse worries about that

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:16.930
because that tends to be a mistake.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:23.930
So now we're going to get the user's name
and age. Remember the name was a string, and

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:30.180
the age was an int. When we get input from
users, we always have to prompt them and tell

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:37.180
them what to enter, so let's do that. To prompt
the user, you use system out print line, and

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:48.509
we'll say enter your age. So age is keyboard,
which is the name of our scanner object, dot

00:07:55.449 --> 00:08:02.449
next int. The next thing we want to get is
the person's name, system out print line enter

00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:14.740
your name. So name equals keyboard dot next
line. Now the reason we're using next line

00:08:24.669 --> 00:08:29.430
there is that people's names can have more
than one part. You could have a first name

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:36.229
and a middle name and a last name, for example,
and this will get all those different parts.

00:08:36.229 --> 00:08:41.630
Particularly when you're new to programming,
it's a good idea to echo your input, so let's

00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:48.630
do that. So your name is, and this is in a
system out print line statement, name, and

00:08:57.740 --> 00:09:04.740
system dot out dot print line your age is
plus age. We're now ready to run our program.

00:09:10.959 --> 00:09:15.899
Running a program goes with the little arrow
key up here. You can also call it from a menu

00:09:15.899 --> 00:09:21.420
if you want. It's the run menu right here.
It's the first choice in it. But I find the

00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:28.420
little arrow to be much more convenient. So
we're going to enter your age. I'm going to

00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:38.360
lie egregiously and say that I'm 19. And oh
my goodness, our program did something wrong.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.830
Notice it didn't wait to get my name. And
now it says my name is blank, and my age is

00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:47.450
19. So the age is being entered all right,
but the name isn't.

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:52.260
Now, let me be honest. Normally you enter
the name first, then the age. And the reason

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:56.410
I did it in this order was to show you this
problem because it's a very common problem

00:09:56.410 --> 00:10:03.410
to have come up. What's happened here is after
we entered 19, we hit the carriage return.

00:10:04.410 --> 00:10:10.300
That probably looks like an enter on your
keyboard. The next line method reads that

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:16.680
carriage return as the next character to be
read, and as a result it doesn't have a name

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.180
at all. The name is empty at this point. So
we have to do this a little bit differently.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:29.180
To fix this problem, what we do is explicitly
read in the carriage return right after the

00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:37.529
integer. That way when the name is entered,
it will be on the next line and will be read

00:10:37.529 --> 00:10:44.529
in properly. Let's run our program again.
The age is 19, the name, Deborah. Name is

00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:58.640
Deborah, age is 19. I think you can see some
of the advantages of working on programs a

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:04.320
little bit at a time now. If we hadn't done
this work, if we hadn't printed things out,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:09.470
we wouldn't know that we had made that mistake
until much later. It is much easier to debug

00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:14.850
three lines of code than it is to debug ten
lines of code.

00:11:14.850 --> 00:11:19.480
So our strategy is going to be check early
and check often. We wanted to make sure the

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:26.390
input's working, and now it is. Here's another
explanation of what happened in our code.

00:11:26.390 --> 00:11:32.010
When the program prompted enter your age,
I entered 19 and then the enter key. It then

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:38.370
prompted enter your first name, and I entered
Deborah and the enter key. The 19 was read

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:44.610
by the next int, and the enter was originally
read by the next line. We fixed it by reading

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:51.610
the enter by the next line, and then using
another next line statement to get the name.

00:12:01.730 --> 00:12:08.730
Let's recall the math. Let's say you're 19.
220 minus 19 is 201. 201 times 65 divided

00:12:11.899 --> 00:12:18.899
by 100 is 130.65. 201 times 85 divided by
100 is 170.85. So your target heart rate would

00:12:22.529 --> 00:12:29.529
be between 131 and 171 beats per minute. This
means your ten second pulse would be between

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:37.480
130.65 times 10 divided by 60, which is 21.83,
and 170.85 times 10 divided by 60, which is

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.700
28.5. Now remember this slide is written in
math, not Java, so we're not thinking about

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:54.149
things like integer division versus double
division.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:59.310
Let's create this calculation. Now, we want
to perform and check one step at a time, and

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:03.880
we want to be very careful about the differences
between double and int. Remember that these

00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:08.920
do not work the same in computer science that
they do in math. Division is particularly

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.850
troublesome, so it always pays to take an
extra second to consider division when you're

00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:20.850
writing code. Now we had some constants. We
had crazy constant, which equaled 220. We

00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:39.540
had double low percent, which equaled 0.65.
Now that zero actually isn't required there,

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:49.550
but I like to put it in when I have doubles
to make it very clear that I'm dealing with

00:13:49.550 --> 00:13:55.230
a double. Periods can be very small on the
screen, and so it helps to put the zero there

00:13:55.230 --> 00:14:02.230
so you can see that there's a period more
easily. Then we'll have final double high

00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:09.760
percent is 0.85. So the first thing we did
is we have our value, which we're going to

00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:23.760
call an int, which is crazy constant minus
age. Now the parentheses there are not necessary,

00:14:31.690 --> 00:14:38.690
and in fact I'm not sure they're helpful,
so I'm going to take them out. Now we'll have

00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:51.389
a double, which I'll call low heart rate,
and that's going to equal value times low

00:14:54.570 --> 00:15:01.570
percent. And we'll have a double called high
heart rate, and it will equal value times

00:15:07.709 --> 00:15:14.709
high percent. Looking at the code here, I
see that I forgot a space before low percent.

00:15:14.820 --> 00:15:18.959
It doesn't actually matter to how the code
works, but on the other hand you want to keep

00:15:18.959 --> 00:15:24.370
your code as beautiful as you possibly can.
It's very well worth the time you spend beautifying

00:15:24.370 --> 00:15:31.370
code. Now these are doubles, and we need to
change them to 10 second heart rates before

00:15:32.889 --> 00:15:37.509
we can print them out. It might not be a bad
idea to print them out right now just to make

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:44.509
sure that everything's going okay. So let's
do system out print line low is plus low heart

00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:55.800
rate, and system out print line high is and
then high heart rate. We probably aren't going

00:16:03.630 --> 00:16:08.509
to keep this in the program permanently. We're
just doing it to check as we go along. This

00:16:08.509 --> 00:16:15.509
is the "write a little, compile a little,
test a little" strategy. So when we run again,

00:16:18.529 --> 00:16:25.529
we'll see enter your age, which I will once
again set at 19, very falsely, and we see

00:16:30.350 --> 00:16:37.350
we're between 130.65 and 170.85. So it looks
like everything's going just fine. So let's

00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:45.220
get rid of those. We might also get rid of
the your name is Deborah and your age is 18

00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:50.600
because those were also just debugging code.
Now there are some people that like to just

00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.670
comment things like that out, and sometimes
that can be a good idea. I think it tends

00:16:55.670 --> 00:17:00.630
to make the code look messy though, and so
I don't like it. I like my code to be clean

00:17:00.630 --> 00:17:07.630
and easy to read. Now we need to change to
a 10 second heart rate. So we had a final,

00:17:13.319 --> 00:17:20.319
which is a double, and we called it something
like 10 seconds, and it equals 10.0 divided

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:29.510
by 60.0. Remember we put the point zeros in
there to keep this as a double division. If

00:17:29.510 --> 00:17:36.510
we made it an integer, it would be zero, and
that would not be helpful. Now, when people

00:17:42.559 --> 00:17:48.490
count heart rates, they usually count an integral
number of beats per 10 seconds. They don't

00:17:48.490 --> 00:17:53.020
count 10 and a third beats, and in fact, it's
very hard to do that. So we're going to have

00:17:53.020 --> 00:18:00.020
to think about how we're going to get our
10 second heartbeats. Let's do int 10 second

00:18:00.179 --> 00:18:07.179
low equals—well, we're going to take our
low heart rate and multiply by 10 seconds.

00:18:11.780 --> 00:18:18.100
Now, you can see Eclipse isn't happy because
it has a red line under low heart rate times

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:24.150
10 seconds. The reason it's unhappy is because
of the types. Low heart rate is a double,

00:18:24.150 --> 00:18:29.850
and 10 seconds is a double. When we multiply
two doubles together, we get a double, and

00:18:29.850 --> 00:18:34.880
we're trying to store a double in an integer
variable. That doesn't work. Java can't figure

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.850
out whether you want to round or anything
like that on its own. You have to give it

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:44.990
very explicit instructions. So what we're
going to do is round. So we're going to add

00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:51.990
0.5 and then truncate. Now, the way you truncate
in Java is with an integer cast.

00:19:03.919 --> 00:19:10.919
Probably a good idea for us to print this
out right now. We can perfect it later 
just to make sure our program is going in

00:19:21.289 --> 00:19:28.289
the right direction before we make the same
mistake twice. Age is 19, still Deborah, and

00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:43.020
our low is 22. And by the way, in that code
I made one of the classic mistakes that programmers

00:19:43.020 --> 00:19:48.570
make a lot. I forgot to put a space before
low. It's also not very well written, but

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:55.160
we were just testing code, so it doesn't matter
so much. Since that answer we know is correct,

00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:01.820
we can now do the same thing with the high
heart rate, so we'll have an int, which I'll

00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:08.820
call 10 second high, equals and the code will
be just exactly the same. In fact, you could

00:20:09.260 --> 00:20:16.260
cut and paste it if you wanted to. We'll learn
other methods for rounding as we go along.

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:29.130
So now let's write some output for our user.
Your heart should beat between--I'll remember

00:20:34.520 --> 00:20:41.520
my space this time--10 second low, space,
and, space, plus 10 second high 
in 10 seconds. And now we're ready to run

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:08.280
our program for the last time. Well, maybe
it'll be the last time. It's only the last

00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:15.280
time if we get the answer right. Once again,
19. Still Deborah. Your heart should beat

00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:27.860
between 22 and 28 in 10 seconds. Well, that
doesn't look very pretty. So much for it being

00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:34.860
the last time. So let's put times in 10 seconds
and run the program again. It's important

00:21:38.350 --> 00:21:42.380
that you always rerun the program even when
you think you made a change that isn't going

00:21:42.380 --> 00:21:49.380
to matter because it's so easy to make little
mistakes. Your heart should beat between 22

00:21:50.110 --> 00:21:57.110
and 28 times in 10 seconds. That looks good.
So we've shown our output. We've made sure

00:21:57.179 --> 00:22:01.570
that our output was spelled properly, and
that the spacing was attractive. Things like

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:06.039
that are part of professionalism and are very
important to computer scientists.
