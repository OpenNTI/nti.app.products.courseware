00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.499
&gt;&gt;This course uses the Java computer programming
language. People talk a lot about which programming

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.600
language is the best to teach beginning programmers,
sometimes with the strength of conviction

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.450
that is usually reserved for discussions of
religion and politics. And just like discussions

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.099
of religion and politics, the conversation
can create more heat than light.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.980
Java has some good things going for it. First,
it's platform independent. This means that

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:30.079
we can take the same program and run it on
a PC and on a Mac. That's great for this class

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.070
because it means that different students can
write the same program on their own preferred

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.690
computer without special problems coming up.
Java is also from the family of object-oriented

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.329
programming languages. Lots of programming
languages that are used commercially are object-oriented,

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:50.309
so learning Java makes it easier to learn
these other languages. Examples of other object-oriented

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.129
languages include C++, C#, Objective C, and
Ruby.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.449
Java is a modern programming language. It
was designed when it was clear that languages

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.519
would have to deal with some surprisingly
tough problems like security, creating graphical

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.890
user interfaces on many different computer
platforms, and using multiple languages including

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.590
pictographic languages like Mandarin and languages
that are organized differently from English.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.350
Java also allows programs to be multi-threaded.
A thread is a sequence of operations. When

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.399
you have a multi-threaded program, the program
can be doing many different sequences of operations

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:31.399
at the same time. You've probably seen this
in programs, although you may not have known

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:36.250
what to call it. For example, when you use
an email program, you can usually write one

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.000
email for a while, then read other emails
and bounce back and forth. Each email has

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.539
its own thread. This is a great thing to be
able to do with your programs, and Java makes

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.930
it relatively easy. Java also has a very advanced
feature called reflection that is really coolâ€”although

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.079
it's bit beyond the scope of this discussion.
One of the nicest things about Java is that

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:00.969
it has a wonderful and rich library of resources
available. This is called the Application

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:06.840
Programmers Interface or API. Best of all,
the API is well documented with beautifully

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.050
designed web pages that describe what's available.
It takes practice to learn how to use these

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.340
powerful tools, but the practice pays off
with being able to do more interesting and

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.019
fun programs sooner.
If you keep programming, you'll learn lots

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.819
of languages. Every language you learn makes
learning the next language a little easier.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.000
I program in about twenty languages now and
can learn a new language in just a few days.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.310
You'll be able to do the same in time, if
you want to.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.550
Some languages make it harder to learn programming.
For example, I think that it's harder to learn

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.560
languages like C and C++ because success in
these languages depends upon a detailed understanding

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.370
of how computer memory works. Since most students
who are starting to program don't know much

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.140
about computer hardware, this makes it harder
to learn to program. So I don't like to teach

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.560
beginning programmers C or C++, even though
they are two of my favorite languages to use

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.349
and should be a part of any computing professionals'
toolkit.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:06.489
Here's my take on the big programming language
debate. Don't get too worried about whether

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.700
Java is the perfect language for a beginner
or not. I can teach someone to be a good programmer

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.190
in almost any language. So relax and enjoy
Java!
