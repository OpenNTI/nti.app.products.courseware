00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:07.140
&gt;&gt;Let's take a look at how to submit programs
on Janux. In Eclipse you select the correct

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:14.580
project, choose file, export, then general,
file system, and then choose your files. Let

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.449
me show you how it's done.

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:26.449
Here we are in Eclipse. Let's submit some
of the charity donation files for example.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:34.070
So we'll go to file, export, then we pick
file system and click next. And then we have

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:44.180
to navigate until we find the right files.
So here are the source files that are available.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.539
That one's not a good one because we have
lots of files in that case. So let's pick

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:55.539
a different one, let's go to one of our cellphone
examples. Here's our source file here, and

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.199
so we're going to click just cellphone.java.
You will only submit the dot java file. I

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:05.950
don't need the settings or the bins or anything
else.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:12.409
Now the other thing you need to do is to determine
where you want it to be left. Now what I recommend

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.430
you do is create a directory for this inside
your class directory. So you might call it

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.890
something like 'submitted files.' You need
to be very careful not to overwrite previous

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.350
files. We might need those files if there's
a submission problem at some point. It's always

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.750
nice to be able to look back at a student's
computer and see that the file hasn't been

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.430
modified. So please be careful.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.369
So let's say for example that I was going
to do this on the desktop. That's not the

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:47.020
smartest place to put files but it will do
for now. I might create a folder called submitted

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.020
files and then go to that folder. When I click
finish now, it will put our Java file in that

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.750
folder. So let's go and take a look at it.
Here we go to the desktop and here are submitted

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.340
files. And notice in it we've got cellphone.java.
Now if I click in this, it's going to try

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.180
to open it and it's going to get confused
because it doesn't know what to do with Java

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.840
files. So that's not a good thing but you
can see it here in text mode, and that is

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.069
in fact the correct file. Now at the point
where you've done this you're really only

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:36.230
halfway. So we went to the source directory
and we chose the Java files and we chose our

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.260
two directory. Make sure you do not overwrite
files. Eclipse will warn you if you're going

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.050
to overwrite files so don't say yes to that.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.980
Now on Janux what you're going to do is navigate
to the assignment and upload the file that

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.680
you just saved. Please remember that there
is only one upload permitted for each assignment,

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.430
so choose your files carefully. Often people
get so worried about getting that file in

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.120
right before the deadline that they choose
the wrong file and that causes us endless

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.750
grief. So please, please, please, choose carefully.
If you do happen to upload the wrong file,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:21.750
just email me the right file: dtrytten@ou.edu.
We'll work with you. So keep programming!
