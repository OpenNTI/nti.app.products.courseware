00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:07.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Deborah Trytten: Let's install software
on a PC running Windows. Now setup can be

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.700
the trickiest part of this class. Don't give
up hope! Here's the outline of what we're

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.449
going to do. First you need to understand
your computer's setup. You need to pick the

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:22.839
right version of the software, install Java,
then install Eclipse, then install the documentation

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:29.839
(if this is necessary), and check the installation.
We'll go through these steps one at a time.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.149
Now this demo was done on a Windows 7 computer.
If you're running a different version of Windows,

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.710
it will look a little different, but the essential
steps are the same. Unfortunately, Microsoft,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.399
Google, and Mozilla are making changes to
browsers constantly. Daily updates can, and

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.879
sometimes do break things. So don't be too
surprised if you go to bed one night with

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.769
the program working and wake up the next morning
without it working. These things happen in

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:57.949
computer science.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:04.940
Hardware matters. Older computers can be 32
bit. Most newer computers are 64 bit. To check

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.800
whether your computer is 32 or 64 bit, go
to Control Panel, System. So let's discover

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.800
the configuration of our system. We go to
this menu, and choose Control Panel. From

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:27.130
the Control Panel, we choose System. Now this
tells us that I'm running a 64 bit operating

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:34.530
system, which tells you that the computer
must also be 64 bits. So I could install an

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.100
either 32 bit or 64, although I'm going to
install on 64.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.290
To check whether your browser is 32 or 64
bit, you need to know that Firefox can be

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.290
either 32 or 64, Chrome is 32 bit, and Internet
Explorer can be 32 bit or 64 bit. The Task

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:01.230
Manager shows 32 bit software with an asterisk
32 in the Processes tab under the Image Name

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:07.700
column. Next we need to check our browsers.
So we need to start the browsers first. This

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.700
is Firefox, and here is Internet Explorer.
Now we go to the Task Manager and what we

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.840
see here, in the Processes tab under the Image
Name column, is that Internet Explorer is

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.590
running in 64 bit. Now you can tell that because
there isn't a star 32 after it. Firefox, on

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:38.510
the other hand, is running in 32 bit. So that
means that if I install 64 bit Java, I won't

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.510
be able to use 32 bit Firefox. Now you can
run 32 bit software on a 64 bit computer,

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.560
but you can't run 64 bit software on a 32
bit computer. The software tools for this

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:59.350
class need to match. So you need to strategically
choose your configuration.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:05.340
Here's a good configuration for a 32 bit computer.
Everything needs to be 32 bit. This includes

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.630
Java, Eclipse, and your browsers. Now the
good news is your browsers will be 32 bit

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:17.630
automatically. So if you have a 32 bit computer,
these are the choices you need to make. There

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:24.470
are two possible good configurations for a
64 bit computer. One is to install Java in

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.950
32 bit, Eclipse in 32 bit, and choose a 32
bit browser, which could be Firefox, Chrome,

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:35.709
or even Internet Explorer installed in 32
bit version if you don't have it already.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:42.360
Advantage of this configuration is if one
browser breaks, you'll have lots of options.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:49.360
A second good configuration for a 64 bit computer
is to install Java in 64 bit, Eclipse in 64

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.300
bit, and choose a 64 bit browser, which could
be either Internet explorer or Firefox if

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:01.140
you don't have it already. It doesn't matter
which one of these two configurations you

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.819
choose. What matters is the consistency of
the installation.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:12.800
So let's talk through the installation of
Java. First, you'll go to http://java.sun.com.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:17.449
Choose the latest edition of Java. Now this
is Java Standard Edition, which is called

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:24.449
Java SE version 7 update 45 is what's available
today. Now tomorrow it might be update 46

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:30.689
and the day after it may be update 47. These
small differences really don't matter for

00:04:30.689 --> 00:04:36.599
this class. You need to download the version
without NetBeans, read and accept the license

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:43.599
agreement, and then download the proper version.
The x86 version is 32 bit, and the x64 is

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:46.330
64 bit.

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:53.330
Now let's download the latest version of Java.
I'm going to Firefox, and then to java.sun.com.

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:03.219
When we get here, we see over under new downloads
is Java SE 7 Update 45. That's the version

00:05:05.759 --> 00:05:12.759
we want to download, so I click there. When
we get here, we have two versions available

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:20.499
- one is regular Java and one has NetBeans.
We want regular Java. On this screen, we accept

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:27.379
the license agreement - you may want to read
it first - and then we pick the correct version

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:34.370
of the software. So this'll be Windows x64,
because I'm doing a 64 bit installation, so

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.370
we click here. Now you need to save this file
to someplace where you know where it is. I

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:48.550
recommend either your Downloads folder or,
better yet, to your desktop. So here's the

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:53.650
desktop. Now you're going to want to click
save. I'm going to click cancel because I've

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.469
already downloaded the software. As you can
see, it's right there.

00:05:58.469 --> 00:06:02.789
Now that you have the software downloaded,
you'll save the executable to the desktop,

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.529
and run the executable from the desktop. Install
the default configuration in the default location,

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:14.589
please. It's very important to have it in
the default location because if we need to

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:19.729
help you debug your installation, it's helpful
to be able to find things and not have to

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:24.689
search for them. Now we need both the Runtime
Environment and the software development kit

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:30.619
- and both of them will be installed. Now
that we've downloaded the Java installation

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:37.619
package to the desktop, we click on it to
start installation. We definitely want to

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:44.960
allow the following program to make changes.
Now it's saying that the software's already

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:50.430
been installed. That's because I've installed
it previously. You probably won't see this

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:57.430
screen. Windows is now configuring the software
development kit, and now we go through the

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:21.469
wizard. Remember, we're not making any changes
here, just click next. And now we've successfully

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:45.270
installed the software development kit.

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:51.789
The next thing we need to do is to install
Eclipse. So go to http://eclipse.org, choose

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:57.199
download Eclipse, and I'll use Eclipse standard.
You need to choose the proper version here

00:07:57.199 --> 00:08:04.199
too, either 32 bit or 64 bit, and download
it to the desktop. Next, we're going to download

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:12.259
Eclipse. I've gone to the Firefox browser,
and I'll enter eclipse.org. This takes us

00:08:21.899 --> 00:08:28.229
to the homepage for Eclipse. We choose download
Eclipse, right over here at the big yellow

00:08:28.229 --> 00:08:35.229
box, and here's the Eclipse Standard Version
right at the top. Now I want the 64 bit version

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:42.639
because I installed Java in 64 bits. You can
choose whatever site you want. I usually just

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:50.750
accept the default one. So now you're going
to save the file. I recommend saving it to

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:57.709
the desktop. As you can see, I've already
saved it so I won't save it again. But you

00:08:57.709 --> 00:09:03.940
will click save, even though I'm clicking
cancel. The next thing you need to do is to

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.120
extract Eclipse. To do this you right click
on the compressed Eclipse folder and select

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:16.019
extract all. Then you browse for the proper
folder. Now this'll be C:\Program Files (x86)

00:09:16.019 --> 00:09:23.019
or 32 bit software or C:\Program Files for
64 bit software. At some point you'll have

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:28.110
to accept administrator permissions to do
this. This will create an Eclipse folder in

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:34.649
the proper directory. The next thing you'll
do is create an Eclipse shortcut. So you'll

00:09:34.649 --> 00:09:39.269
go to the Eclipse directory you created and
create a shortcut by dragging the icon with

00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:43.750
the purple circle to your task bar. Now this
is optional, but it's highly recommended.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:48.779
We'll be using Eclipse every single day in
this class. You're going to want to have it

00:09:48.779 --> 00:09:49.740
handy.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:56.740
Now we'll extract Eclipse. So from the desktop,
we right click and choose extract all. Now,

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:05.500
we need to browse for the correct directory.
This will go to the computer, the C drive,

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:13.300
and then program files for the 64 bit version,
which is the one I selected. Or program files

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:21.470
x86 if you're downloading in 32 bit. Then
choose extract. Now it's going to require

00:10:25.339 --> 00:10:32.319
security permission because we're downloading
to the program files directory, and here it

00:10:32.319 --> 00:10:39.319
goes. Now to finish off our installation,
we're going to go to the C directory, Program

00:10:50.410 --> 00:10:57.410
Files, Eclipse, and take our Eclipse icon
- this little purple circle right here - and

00:10:57.449 --> 00:11:04.360
drag it onto the task bar. Right like that.
That way we'll always have it available when

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:11.360
we need it. The next thing we need to do is
to access the Java API. Now API stands for

00:11:12.139 --> 00:11:17.139
Application Programmers Interface, and it's
the description of resources that Java has

00:11:17.139 --> 00:11:24.139
for us to use. So if you go and click on it,
you'll see what the API looks like. So here's

00:11:30.459 --> 00:11:37.459
the API showing up in my browser. I'll show
you how to use it during the semester. I recommend

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:44.300
that you bookmark this, so you can have easy
access. Now, you also can install software

00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:49.199
for this on your computer. It isn't necessary
if you have a good Internet connection most

00:11:49.199 --> 00:11:52.959
of the time. But if you don't have a good
Internet connection, this is a step you'll

00:11:52.959 --> 00:11:56.819
definitely want to take.

00:11:56.819 --> 00:12:00.860
The next thing you want to do is to check
your installation. So you'll start Eclipse

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:06.029
from the task bar, create a workspace in a
good location. So we'll browse and create

00:12:06.029 --> 00:12:10.529
a new folder in a directory that you reserve
for your college courses, or if you don't

00:12:10.529 --> 00:12:15.029
have one of those, we'll make one. You need
to get rid of the welcome screen, and create

00:12:15.029 --> 00:12:22.029
a project. So that's File, New, Java Project,
and I'll call the project name Sample. And

00:12:22.089 --> 00:12:29.089
then you'll finish that. First, we start Eclipse
from the task bar. We choose to run, although

00:12:29.939 --> 00:12:36.939
you might want to consider clicking that box
so you don't get asked every time. Now we

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:43.490
want to choose a new workspace. So we'll browse
for that. The desktop is one reasonable place

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:48.699
to put a workspace, but let's make sure we
make a new folder. So this new folder will

00:12:48.699 --> 00:12:55.699
be called CS 1323 Workspace, and then we'll
click OK. Eclipse will now open to the welcome

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:09.970
screen. Now this is something you won't see
every time, and it's not something that's

00:13:09.970 --> 00:13:15.519
particularly useful. What we need is the workbench
and to get to it, you click the arrow right

00:13:15.519 --> 00:13:22.519
there. Inside of Eclipse we'll have many projects,
so let's create our first one. We'll do File,

00:13:24.139 --> 00:13:31.139
New, Java Project, and I'll call this project
Sample and click Finish. Now, if you click

00:13:33.529 --> 00:13:37.620
here under the package explorer, you'll see
that Eclipse has saved several things for

00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:39.879
us.

00:13:39.879 --> 00:13:45.759
The next thing you need to do is to create
a class. So you'll go to File, New, Class.

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:50.560
The name of the class should be Computer Science
Is Grand. Now notice there are no spaces between

00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:55.610
these words, and each word starts with a capital
letter. That's called Camel Case, and that's

00:13:55.610 --> 00:14:01.060
how we write class names. Then you need to
check the box to get public static void main

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:06.110
string square brackets args. Those are where
the instructions of the computer runs are

00:14:06.110 --> 00:14:10.920
put, so it's important that you have that
method. Then I'll do some beautifying of the

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.860
code. I'm going to move some curly braces
around. I'm going to edit some comments and

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:22.860
remove a to do line. So we go File, New, Class.
And we're going to call this class Computer

00:14:25.769 --> 00:14:31.249
Science Is Grand. It's important that there
are no spaces in this name and that it's in

00:14:31.249 --> 00:14:38.249
Camel Case. We're going to check the box here
to get a main method and click Finish. Now

00:14:39.939 --> 00:14:44.209
unfortunately, Eclipse doesn't do things just
the way I like. So I'm going to make a few

00:14:44.209 --> 00:14:50.389
little adjustments here to put things just
the way I want them. The reason I like it

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:56.649
this way is lining up curly braces makes it
easier to see that your code is correct.

00:14:56.649 --> 00:15:00.329
The next thing we're going to do is add some
output. So we'll go to the webpage for the

00:15:00.329 --> 00:15:07.329
Association of Computing Machinery and pick
your favorite reason to study computer science.

00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.199
So here are the 10 reasons, so look for something
that really resonates with you. Computing

00:15:16.199 --> 00:15:21.220
is part of everything we do -- boy, that's
true. Expertise in computing enables you to

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:27.009
solve complex and challenging problems - that's
true too! Computing enables you to make a

00:15:27.009 --> 00:15:31.279
positive difference in the world - now that's
something that really resonates with me, so

00:15:31.279 --> 00:15:38.279
that's what I'm going to put in my program.
Now you'll add one line of code to the main

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:42.970
program. It will be system out print line
- Computing enables you to make a positive

00:15:42.970 --> 00:15:48.610
difference in the world in double quotes.
Be very careful. Watch the capitalization,

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:54.540
and the punctuation, and the spelling. It
all has to be perfect. Notice that the start

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:58.949
and end double quotes should be the same.
Now PowerPoint makes them little sixes and

00:15:58.949 --> 00:16:03.589
nines, but those are not the ones you use
in programming. So you have to be careful

00:16:03.589 --> 00:16:09.939
to use the ones that are near the enter key.
Do not cut and paste from PowerPoint.

00:16:09.939 --> 00:16:16.939
Now we're going to put the body of the main
method in. System out print line, computing

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:29.290
enables you to make a positive difference
in the world. Now we're a little short of

00:16:34.029 --> 00:16:38.660
space here, so let's clear some things out.
We really don't need this outline, and that

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:44.279
gives us some more space, and if we make it
full screen we can see the whole line. Always

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:48.350
make sure that you can see all of your lines
because if you can't see them, it's hard to

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:51.519
tell what's on them.

00:16:51.519 --> 00:16:57.129
So now it's time to run your program. Choose
Run, Run to run your program. And you should

00:16:57.129 --> 00:17:02.600
see your chosen slogan in the console window.
If it doesn't work, there's probably some

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.870
small error in your program. Compare it very
carefully to the example. Let's see, for example,

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:14.790
what happens if we change System with a capital
S to system with a little S. Now you'll notice

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:20.500
Eclipse will give us a red X and that helps
us find problems, sometimes. Also you can

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.300
get help on Janux social media if you need
it.

00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:31.300
Now it's time to run our program. So you can
choose Run, Run from the menu. Click OK to

00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:38.220
the box, and you'll see our slogan printed
out exactly as we entered it - computing enables

00:17:38.220 --> 00:17:43.650
you to make a positive difference in the world.
Now, if you didn't see that, don't worry and

00:17:43.650 --> 00:17:49.580
don't panic. It's probably just some small
typo. For example, maybe you put in a small

00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.750
S instead of a capital S in system. Now notice
that Eclipse is trying to help you out by

00:17:54.750 --> 00:18:00.160
putting a little red X at the side. Sometimes
Eclipse is right, sometimes it isn't. But

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.570
if you're wondering, it's always a good idea
to look. So when it says system can't be resolved,

00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:09.900
what that means is that it doesn't know what
system is. That's a hint that you may have

00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:15.150
something spelled wrong or capitalized wrong
or have the wrong punctuation in. Notice that

00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:21.120
if we change back to a capital S, Eclipse
quickly becomes happy again. Now if you need

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:26.300
more help, get help on Janux social media.

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:31.250
The next thing we're going to do is check
the installation. So we'll go to coding bat.

00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:37.650
Now if you're in the for credit class, you
need to share your results with me at dtrytten@ou.edu.

00:18:37.650 --> 00:18:41.670
Please don't do this if you're in the open
class. I can't look at your programs and see

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:47.540
what you've done. I can only see if they are
correct or not, so it's not helpful. To check

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:52.640
the installation we'll go to warm-up one,
choose sum double, and enter exactly this

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:59.640
code between the curly braces: if A equals
equals B return four times A semi-colon and

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:07.270
return A plus B. Hit go. If you get a green
check, that means it's installed correctly.

00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:14.340
Let's check the installation of Java Bat.
First off, we bring up a web browser - I brought

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:23.380
up Firefox, and we go to codingbat.com. Choose
the sum double problem under warm-up one and

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:36.210
enter this code between the curly braces:
if A equals equals B return four times A return

00:19:39.660 --> 00:19:46.660
A plus B. Click Go. If you have a green check
here, that means everything is working great

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:51.890
with Java Bat.

00:19:51.890 --> 00:19:58.710
The next thing we do is to check problets.
Go to http://problets.org, choose Topics,

00:19:58.710 --> 00:20:03.290
choose Java. You'll have to accept the risk
of running the application. Now this won't

00:20:03.290 --> 00:20:08.060
happen in all browsers, but it may happen
in yours. If you see a webpage that starts

00:20:08.060 --> 00:20:14.050
with "Please evaluate this expression," then
everything's fine. Now we can check the installation

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:21.050
of problets. Go to Firefox again, go to problets.org,
choose Topics and Java. Now it says, "Please

00:20:30.910 --> 00:20:35.060
note that problet will appear in a separate
window" - we'll need to look for that. We

00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:39.910
are going to have to accept the risk of running
this application. Now let's go and look for

00:20:39.910 --> 00:20:45.960
that other window - right there it is. When
you see "Please evaluate the expression" in

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:50.240
a page that looks like this, it means that
problets are going to work successfully on

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:54.190
your computer.

00:20:54.190 --> 00:21:00.030
Now if the problets don't work, it's probably
a security problem so try another browser.

00:21:00.030 --> 00:21:05.300
Make sure though that it's the correct browser
that matches the bits on your installation.

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:09.690
Now students taking the for credit class will
need to create an account and sign in from

00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:14.650
the link for this semester's class (which
is given on the course management system).

00:21:14.650 --> 00:21:19.450
Please use your full legal name (even if you
don't like it) and your student number, not

00:21:19.450 --> 00:21:26.340
just your email. Remember, I don't know who
sillyStudent@hotmail.org is. I only know your

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:32.470
name. Now security issues can come up during
the course of the semester. Browsers do periodically

00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:38.570
disable Java. You will have to enable Java
to run at some point to get problets and to

00:21:38.570 --> 00:21:44.540
get some of the interactive exercises in the
online textbook called Chortle. Now Turningscraft

00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:48.620
will always work because Java is run on their
server, and Eclipse will work because it's

00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:53.990
running on your system. Javabat is also running
on the system at another school, and so it

00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:59.550
will always work. So get ready to start programming!
