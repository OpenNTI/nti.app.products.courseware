00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:06.639
&gt;&gt;Let's talk about how to use Turing's Craft
in this class. Turing's Craft is a commercial

00:00:06.639 --> 00:00:13.079
website. It has interactive exercises to practice
programming. It checks the correctness of

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:18.060
your answer by testing multiple cases. Now
this turns out to be really important because

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.050
it doesn't check to see that you did the problem
the way they expected you to do the problem.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.480
Instead it actually checks and sees whether
your answer is correct or not. This makes

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.200
a world of difference in doing programming.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.800
The other thing it does is it offers feedback
and help. Now remember that an automated site

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.530
like this is not going to be able to provide
the same quality of help that a person would

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.300
be able to provide, it's just not that intelligent.
But it is a good place to start and often

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.670
it can get you unstuck if you're having difficulty.
The advantages of Turing's Craft are that

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.840
you only need to enter a few lines of code.
Sometimes even just a character or two. So

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.059
this is different then some of the other sites
we'll use where we have to enter whole methods

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.070
or big chunks of code. So this is a big advantage
of Turing's Craft and one of the reasons that

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.040
it's worth paying money for it. It also gives
you instantaneous feedback and that helps

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.979
because it's a lot easier to learn in that
way.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:22.700
You can work problems as many times as desired.
In fact, you'll probably need to work some

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.659
problems many times. I can tell how many times
you've worked a problem, but I don't take

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:34.520
it into grading consideration at all so don't
worry about it. Just relax - do your best.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.159
I can also see your latest submission. However,
I can't see all of your submissions. So if

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.610
you're going to ask me for help make sure
you leave the one that you think is the best

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.290
solution behind so that I can take a look
at it if you email it to me. I only look at

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.450
solutions in general if you ask me for help.
I don't just go pawing around the site randomly

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.310
looking at what people have been doing.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.770
To sign up we're going to go to Turingscraft.com.
Click register, choose student, enter our

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:11.630
access code, and choose a university. Here
we are at the Turing's Craft website. I've

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.270
cut the access code from the PowerPoint presentation
so I'll be able to paste it in when we get

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:24.270
there. You may want to do the same. So we're
going to register and you want to check that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.530
you're a student in a course that uses code
lab. It's very important that you get that

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.580
button checked correctly, because if you don't
I won't be able to see your solutions and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.080
I won't be able to see what work you've done.
That means you won't get credit for it. So

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.080
now click continue. Here's where we enter
our section access code. We're going to choose

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:55.980
the university, this is the University of
Oklahoma, and continue. And from here on you

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.920
enter personally identifiable information.
I'm not going to step you through this because

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.030
I know you all can do this on your own. When
you get to this point you can either pay using

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.430
a credit card or a personal check. If you're
using a personal check you enter your check

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.360
number, you mail the check to Turing's Craft,
they'll trust you for a couple of weeks. Now

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.900
if your check doesn't arrive sooner or later
they will eventually cut off your access,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.290
so please make sure you do send them a check
when you're supposed to.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.290
To preform the exercises you're going to log
in at Turingscraft.com. Not register. Load

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.290
the course. And we're going to select an exercise
to work on. So here we go. We're back at the

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:49.520
Turing's Craft website. Now this time I'm
going to login. They use the email address

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:56.520
you gave them. This is me of course. And you'll
enter a password that you picked during the

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.120
registration process and then I'll load this
course. Now you'll notice that I've got quite

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.790
a few courses here. That's because I've been
using this software for a long time. You'll

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:15.790
only have one. The warm-up exercises are over
here. Let's go and take a look at this one.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:23.070
Now, this one has unusually long instructions
and that's very a-typical for a Turing's Craft

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.120
exercise. Mostly what they're trying to do
is to give you enough information so you can

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.290
do the exercise successfully. So, they're
asking you to write an arithmetic expression

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.900
that calculates the average of eighteen and
forty-six. And then they point out a bunch

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:41.780
of things that you probably know form algebra.
That is the average of two numbers is their

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.780
sum divided by two, they use a slash for division
and the parenthesis are used to hold different

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:51.190
parts of arithmetic together.

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:55.970
Now in this particular problem they actually
even tell you what the right solution is.

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:01.820
That is, open parenthesis eighteen plus forty-six
close parenthesis divide by two. And then

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:08.820
they ask you to try it. So let's move down
and try it. Here's the expression and we're

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:19.190
going to click submit. And you see that it
takes us to the result tab and it says the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.370
code lab analysis says that it's correct,
and then it gives us a little encouraging

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:29.960
message. It also puts your submission there.
Now let's go back and see what happens if

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.960
we don't do it right. Let's say we divide
by three instead of dividing by two. Well

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:44.120
when we submit now we get this red flag. It
says you don't seem to have entered the correct

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.120
expression. Correct solutions that use three
tend to use minus. Now that might not make

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:56.520
sense or seem very helpful, but what they're
trying to say is: "Well, we really were expecting

00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:02.160
two. The only way to get to two from three
is to subtract one." And it says you're using

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:09.160
an incorrect number somewhere in your solution.
So they give you some hints.

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.220
That's really all there is to using Turing's
Craft. Now the next thing we need to do is

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:21.960
to understand some symbols on the website.
A clear box means you haven't attempted the

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:28.300
problem. A green box, you may have noticed,
appears when the problem is completed successfully.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.760
A yellow box means the problem is completed
successfully but it was after the deadline.

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:39.100
I don't accept work that's after the deadline,
so you want to avoid those yellow boxes. A

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:44.490
red box means your answer is incorrect and
still needs additional work. Every now and

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.580
then, and by that I mean I maybe see it once
a year, you're going to see a black box. What

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:54.810
that means is that the problem is out of service.
Like all software, these problems sometimes

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:59.740
break and when they do they take the problem
out of service until they can repair it. Don't

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:06.740
worry; I won't take off any points on those
questions. As far as grading Turing's Craft,

00:07:07.639 --> 00:07:12.919
the section names correspond to the names
in Janux for the daily sections and each section

00:07:12.919 --> 00:07:18.280
has a due date. I do change them during the
semester sometimes, and if I change the due

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.940
date Turing's Craft recalculates whether your
work was late or not. Generally they're due

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.870
two days after the material is assigned. The
exception is things that are assigned on Friday

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.090
are actually due on Monday, so I give you
an extra day there. And each problem is worth

00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:40.200
one point. Now that's actually a pretty good
deal, because Turing's Craft has a lot of

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.590
problems at the beginning of the semester
when things are easier. Later in the semester

00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:50.110
the problems do get harder but of course later
in the semester we also have fewer assignments

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:57.009
and more assignments that are not in Turing's
Craft. So it all works out okay. So keep programming.
