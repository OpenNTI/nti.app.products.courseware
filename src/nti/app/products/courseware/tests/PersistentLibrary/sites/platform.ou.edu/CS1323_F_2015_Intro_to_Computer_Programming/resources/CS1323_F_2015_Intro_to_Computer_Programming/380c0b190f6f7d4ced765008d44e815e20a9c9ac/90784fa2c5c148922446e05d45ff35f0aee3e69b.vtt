00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.410
&gt;&gt;Olivia Pham: So you're taking a course at
OU. We are members of the Integrity Council,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.139
and we would like to take a few moments to
tell you about the standards of Academic Integrity

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.340
that we have here on the OU-Norman and OU-Tulsa
campuses.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.089
&gt;&gt;Joel Maupin: First of all, you may be wondering
what the Integrity Council is. OU has a student

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:22.980
led system for maintaining the integrity of
academic work and the degree that work leads

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:29.449
to. Students on the Integrity Council investigate
reported violations, chair misconduct hearings,

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:33.390
recommend penalties, and serve as peer educators
in integrity courses.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.079
&gt;&gt;Wes Herron: On our campus, students care
about academic integrity. These aren't just

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.079
rules handed down by the administration, but
a system that values student input and is

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.859
designed to protect the rights of students.
A college degree is an expensive and time-consuming

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:52.070
investment in a student's future. Having high
academic standards not only protects the reputation

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.620
of the OU education, but increases the value
of the OU degree. Something, I know, we're

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.519
all working very hard to get.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.690
&gt;&gt;Joel: Now that you know why we care about
academic integrity at OU, let's get started.

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.460
A great resource for all students to refer
to is our website: integrity.ou.edu. A very

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.010
helpful document on that website is the student's
guide to academic integrity. We know that

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:21.040
you're busy and that you have to take online
tutorials from various offices on campus,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.570
read books, write papers, take exams, and
so much more while you're at OU.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.010
&gt;&gt;Olivia: But when you're a member of the
OU community, you're expected to know the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:35.330
rules. "I didn't know" or "I didn't mean to"
is never an excuse for cheating. The student's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.540
guide will give you a brief overview on how
the system works, the process once a report

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.090
has been filed, as well as common kinds of
academic misconduct.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.910
&gt;&gt;Wes: But while we've got your attention
we want to cover a few common kinds of cheating

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.030
that every student can and should avoid.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:54.000
&gt;&gt;Olivia: Plagiarism. Including copy and paste
plagiarism from outside sources with no attempt

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.810
at citation, failing to properly cite works
or ideas taken from outside sources, turning

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.590
in a paper you have already submitted for
a grade here or at another institution, also,

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.140
improper collaboration and sharing your work
with others. At OU the basic assumption when

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.950
completing academic work is that: all work
will be completed independently by the student

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.870
unless specifically told otherwise by the
professor. Another issue is unauthorized materials

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.950
on an exam, ranging from old fashion cheat
sheets and writing on hands, to the more sophisticated

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:29.920
use of cell phones and smart watches. In addition,
remember, the same rules of academic integrity

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.950
that apply in the physical classroom apply
in online courses.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.569
&gt;&gt;Joel: For more information on kinds of cheating
at OU, especially plagiarism, and how to avoid
