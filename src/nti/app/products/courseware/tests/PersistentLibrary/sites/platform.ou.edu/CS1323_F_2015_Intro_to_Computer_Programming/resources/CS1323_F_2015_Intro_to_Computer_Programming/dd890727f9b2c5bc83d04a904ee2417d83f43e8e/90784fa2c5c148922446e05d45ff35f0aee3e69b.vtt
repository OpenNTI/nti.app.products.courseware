00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:07.979
&gt;&gt;Let's submit multiple program files on Janux.
In Eclipse, first we need to select the correct

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:15.290
project, then we need to choose file, export,
then general, archive file. The reason this

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.310
needs to be an archive file is when you're
submitting multiple files, you have to combine

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.349
them together into one package. If you don't
do that you can't submit them on Janux because

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:33.349
Janux will only accept one file. So let's
go to Eclipse and do that.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.010
Here we are in Eclipse. Notice that in our
Frogger project, we have multiple classes.

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:55.260
In fact we have five of them here that we
need to submit. So we're going to go to file,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.260
export, and now we're going to pick archive
file. Not file system because we want Eclipse

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:09.719
to put all these files together into one archive
file-- in this case, a zip file. So now we

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.450
go and select the correct files. So here's
the project. Now, you need to be careful with

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.810
this. I don't need your settings and I don't
want your binary files. Bin stands for binary,

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.480
those are the compiled files. It's not good
for us to run those files on our computers

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.320
because if your computer has a virus my computer
will get it. So I tend to create the files

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:36.860
myself.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:41.150
Now inside the source directory notice that
all the .java files have been selected by

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.100
default, if they weren't selected I would
pick them. You're almost always going to want

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.100
to submit all your files. Now we're going
to browse for the submitted files folder we

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.540
created before. Now I've put mine on the desktop
that may not be the best place for it. And

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:08.379
so we pick this directory. And we want to
give a name to the file. So this might be

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:15.379
Frogger.zip. So now we can see that it's going
to be saved to an archive file in a location

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:23.310
that we know and that we have only the minimum
number of files that we would possibly need.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.719
Notice this little blue box with the minus
sign in it? That's a way of saying that not

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:32.640
everything has been selected, so that's actually
correct. The check here means that everything

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.950
has. So now we finish it and we're done.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:45.950
So let's go and see what it looks like on
the desktop. Here we are in submitted files

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:55.599
and notice what we have is Frogger.zip. That's
the file we want to submit on Janux. So to

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.480
refresh your memory, you open the project
directory, go to the source, and choose the

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.480
.java files only. Include as few files as
possible in absolutely no dot class files.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.299
The dot class files can be tricky because
they have the same names as the .java files.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:20.599
In fact those are the ones that are created
by the compiler. But I don't want those files.

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:24.769
I want your Java files. I want the ones I
can easily read.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.769
Don't include files in dot settings, bin,
or dock. Then choose your archive file carefully.

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:36.980
Don't overwrite existing files, and make sure
you leave your backup copy in tack just in

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:42.420
case we need it later. After you've created
your zip file, you're going to navigate to

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:48.459
the file on Janux and upload the file. Please
remember that only one upload is permitted

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.879
at this time. That means that if you upload
the wrong file you're going to email me the

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:58.769
right file, dtrytten@ou.edu same as always.
So keep programming!
