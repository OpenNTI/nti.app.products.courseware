00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.460
This video will demonstrate how to navigate

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.950
through the video lessons in your Janux course.
You’ll be able to watch the videos, read

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.730
along with complete transcription plus access
closed captioning. To view the videos created

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.470
for your class, sign in to Janux. This will bring up your courses.

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.269
Select the course you would like to work on
and when it loads, select Lessons at the top

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.310
of the screen. Using the vertical list of
lessons on the left side of the screen, choose

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.319
the video lesson you’d like to view. Hitting
the play arrow will begin the video playing.

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:35.140
The information bar at the bottom of the video
window will tell you the length of the video

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.200
and allow you to turn up or down the volume.
On the right side of the information bar is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.760
a selector to change the resolution of the
video. The higher the resolution the better

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.890
the picture. You’ll want to play with these
settings to get the maximum picture quality

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.010
allowed by your internet connection. It’s
suggested you start at the highest resolution

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.780
and work your way to the lower end stopping
when the video plays most smoothly. Next to

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.829
that is an icon that allows you to expand
the picture size to full size, filling your

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.150
computer screen. Every video on the Janux
system is transcribed. The transcription can

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.140
be selected to view while the video plays.
Notice the transcript plays in time with the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.320
video. At the top of the player you can choose
Split Transcript to make the transcript the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.100
main focus of the screen or you can choose
Split Video to make the video the main focus

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.740
of the screen. These transcriptions open the
door to powerful note taking and discussion

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.590
tools that are covered in other videos. They
allow you to make notes that remain in place

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.659
on the transcript, share your notes with others,
save them privately and easily access them

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:46.409
for future reference. Next to the Split Transcription
icon is this gallery icon. Clicking this will

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.010
bring up access to ALL of the videos in the
course. This will help you quickly navigate

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:56.140
to find an older video you would like to reference.
Another way to read along with the video is

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.970
to use the captioning feature. Captions can
be turned on in the upper left corner of the

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.180
screen. They will appear at the bottom of
the screen like television closed captioning.

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.050
Finally, we want to let you know you can alter
the type of player used in Janux for videos.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:15.300
An HTML5 player is available and can be accessed
by clicking on your profile picture. Go to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.450
Manage Account and select Preferences.
There’s a click box that reads: Prefer experimental

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:25.790
HTML5 video when possible.
Clicking this will allow Janux to offer improved

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:30.790
video playback in some cases, including when
you log in on an iPad. You’ve just seen

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.920
how to navigate the videos set up for your
Janux course.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.540
We demonstrated how to find the video lessons,
how to play the video, control the volume

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.250
and change the picture quality by adjusting
the resolution. We’ve also covered the accompanying

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.310
transcriptions and how to access closed captioning.
Additionally we showed you the video gallery

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.630
for quick access to all videos in the course
and we covered the alternate video player

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.319
available in Janux.
There are more videos in this library designed

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:00.200
to teach you how to take advantage of the
features in Janux, please be sure to watch

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.640
these ‘how to’ videos before you begin
your coursework.
